B000NV4GMY,The Good Earth,,,,0/2,2.0,922752000,It was alright I guess,"The book I have read, The Good Earth, tales place in the early 19th century, in a small farming and agricultural town in China. It shows the hardships that took place in these time through a specific character. His passion for his land was greater then any other. His name is Wang Lung, The Farmer. He had lived in a dirt &quot;hut&quot; with his father, ever since he was a child. Many centuries have been raised in this house and have been brought up on the land. One day was his wedding day, and Wang Lung was petrified of going forth to the Great House of Hwang ( where his maid was living and was sold to when a young child). Eventually as time went on the maid, whose name is O-Lan, they had started to have children. W.L. (Wang Lung) had felt that he was very fortunate since his first few children were males. He had then started to feel the riches in his hand and started to buy land and more land, feeling richer by the day.One time, W.L.'s evil uncle had come over and seemed to put a &quot;spell&quot; on the house, spreading his evil ways around. W.L. was sure that his uncle was evil because shortly after, W.L.'s land, that he had love so greatly, had started to dry up. An enormous drought had fallen over him while a flock of black birds circled over his head( which was considered an evil omen ). O-Lan had then started to bare slaves, or women in which they called them this. The family was eventually forced to the south, driven to beg for money. W.L. was sure that sooner or later he was going to go back to land. As the book progresses it shows how W.L.'s life changes as he goes back to the north. He soon possesses the name &quot;Wang the Great&quot; and others similar. He learns that life is not only just money, but it is also the family, cultures... and what he feels is most important is his land that he wishes that it will never be sold.The book The Good Earth is for people who really like themes and morality types of things. Some parts for me were alright, but O would say that it was not the best I have ever read. Many parts are very descriptive, which I enjoy when it is a big deal or main part in the book. But other parts drone on about the smallest ideas...which I can't take! Although it isn't a book that I would love to read, it is still an important book to read. It teaches the reader about Chinese culture and the theme of morality."
0486417824,Dubliners (Dover Large Print Classics),9.95,AHD101501WCN1,"Shalom Freedman ""Shalom Freedman""",0/0,5.0,1267056000,"A story collection which defines a world, and provides the themes for the great expansions to follow","'Dubliners' is not a group of stories simply, but rather a group of stories which defines a world. Joyce here outlines those themes which he will expand upon and elaborate stage- by- stage in the ""Portrait"" in 'Ulysses"" in ""Finnegan's Wake"". The city of Dublin and Joyce's home- world are the world in which family, religion, country are in decay. And yet within these tales of frustration and failure, the romantic longing the hints toward transformation of experience through the sacred work of the artist. Joyce's is already, ironically or not, forging in the smithy of his soul the uncreated conscience of his race.This edition of what is now one of the 'classic' short - story collections discusses the work's composition, and provides a bibliography for further studies. It does not however as the 'Norton Critical Edition' does provide essays of explication.What is most important however is the stories themselves which have a kind of lyrical beauty. This is felt most strongly in that tale of stagnation and romantic longing idolized and regretted, 'Dubliners'. In human scope and feeling I personally find Chekhov and also I.B. Singer beyond Joyce as storytellers. But this is surely one of the world's greatest collections of stories."
B0006IU3EE,A Fine Balance,,A2MOBMVHECYVLE,saliero,5/6,5.0,978998400,An exceptional experience,"I was absolutely knocked out by this book. It continues with me long after I finished it. Fragments of text will drift into my mind as I go about my daily activities.I read this book along with cyber-reading mates for an Internet book club, and the conversations that bounced from it are awesome.Mistry has written a raging, angry novel. There ARE darkly funny episodes (like the funeral procession of a beggar). This is a book which has plunged me into a quest to read more and more about this most fascinating of places.Be prepared for an engrossing read. It is not a polemic, yet is potent with symbolism and meaning. The characters and plotting drive the novel. Yet we learn more about India than the longest text might enable.I was swept along and with the 4 main characters, and many of the minor ones. The writing is never trite or contrived. It is literary, yet direct and uncomplicated. Masterful.Thoroughly recommended."
B000GAYFUU,Little Women,,A35GHITTG3WX7E,Taran Wanderer,2/3,5.0,1088640000,A treasured classic!,"Oooh, I have for years wanted to read Little Women by Louisa May Alcott, and I finally got the chance. This book is so amazing, you actually learn to love each one of the characters, yes, even that selfish and smoiled 'Lady' Amy March. The story focuses on four charming yound ladies, Margaret 'Meg', Josephine 'Jo', Elizabeth, 'Beth' (Who by the way is my favorite) and Amy March, these girls are tought several and important lessons, some softly and some a little more harshly by one of their greatest teachers, their mother, Mrs. March, called sweetly by the girls as ""Marmee"".The story begins, slowly and happily in what seems like a perfect world, even if Father is away at war. The sisters make new friends, attend elegant parties, and each find small adventures of their own, at home, at school and everywhere. Of course, things change, dark days come along, Meg is falling in love with Mr. Brooke, Laurie's (The Marches' neighboor) tutor and Jo fears that her sister might soon leave them, and poor shy, sweet Beth gets the scarlet fever, who at the end has very serious and sad consequences.There are happy and sad moments in this wonderful masterpiece, and I recommend anyone to read and enjoy them as much as I did."

0060833874,Daughter of Fortune CD,,A3O77N2UP11WWE,Michael S Gellerman,6/8,3.0,940464000,A little disappointed,"I was a little disappointed with this book. While it was a good story, I found myself thinking more about the history and place and lost interest in Eliza. I thought the book really ran out of steam once she leaves Sacramento - we don't see or feel much about her emotions during the time when she is coming to realize that she is on a journey in search of herself rather than for Joaquin. I wish I had read the book in Spanish because I think this may be a relatively pedestrian transalation.When I finished the book, my first impulse was to go back and read Wallace Stegner's Angle of Repose - a superior but similar novel. I believe that Daughter of Fortune will ultimately be considered a minor work by an otherwise accomplished writer."

B000LCA2QY,When God Was A Woman,,A8S92T3T5DXTV,Patricia Monaghan,19/21,5.0,942624000,One of the first books on the subject,"With the growth of literature on goddess religion in recent years, it is easy to compare Stone's achievement with that of those who have stood on her shoulders. Originally published more than 20 years ago, it has remained steadily in print since, in great part because of its accessibility to the lay audience. Although some of the material in her book has since been superceded, this remains an important and exciting book."
0837173876,Noblesse Oblige; An Enquiry into the Identifiable Characteristics of the English Aristocracy.,,A2NPLZDVV82IW5,"Karen Anderson ""Author, A Fairy-Tale Christma...",5/5,5.0,1275177600,"Attention: all fans of Jane Austen, Lord Peter Wimsey, Evelyn Waugh, Queen Elizabeth, and Annie Tempest:","If you are interested in what the British Aristocracy is all about, or more specifically, what are the external signs of an aristocrat, try to get your hands on a copy of this book. It is a lively exploration of the quaint turns of phrase, social peculiarities, and other habits that identify the British upper-classes (charmingly referred to as U), as distinguished from the lower-classes (non-U).As the title suggests, what makes an aristocrat is a sense of Noblesse Oblige, or the obligation of the nobility to put his high position at the service of those beneath him, and at the service of the common good. That being said, there is always a je ne sais quoi about the fictional and non-fictional characters of the Aristocracy that make them sometimes irresistible and other times loathsome, but always fascinating, and often extremely funny.If you simply want to know for the sake of idle curiosity--or if you want to avoid the blunders (beginning with audible self-promotion and ending with obnoxious table manners) that might make the occasional aristocrat you run into at a dinner party either enjoy your conversation (think of Elizabeth Bennet) or avoid you like the plague, (think of Mr. Collins) you will enjoy this book.If you are a sociologist studying the nature of class-distinctions which the human race routinely creates (in spite of every attempt to prevent it) than you will REALLY enjoy this book.If, on the other hand, the very thought of social class gives you hives, avoid this book at all costs."
0874260582,"The Hogs of Cold Harbor: The Civil War Saga of Private Johnny Hess, CSA",29.0,A2MCQRLZY0M4UJ,M. Cleburne,5/6,5.0,1141084800,Speaks for the dead and defeated - a cult book for Rebels,"No wonder Norman Mailer loved this book. Fulgham has written a controversial work. Arguments are raging online in Civil War groups and writer's groups. He speaks for a dead soldier from a defeated country -- apparently who saw his wounded friends' faces eaten off by wild hogs stalking Civil War battlefields at night. This is a cult book in the making. He wrote online that he's had to drop the internet because six people have sent him viruses after reading ""The Hogs of Cold Harbor"".This author is a hot potato. Drop him if you can't take the heat. Hold him a little while and his work is delicious, well written, horrifying -- and as a reviewer at ""Civil War News"" said ""as brutal and ironic as a Civil War"". He brings a dead soldier to life. He reminds me of Remarque in ""All Quiet on the Western Front"". IMO there is no better writer working in America today."

I purchased a Bowflex and was not quite sure what to do with it. This books really outlines a plan that you can follow and it has been three weeks and I can already see results. The author of this book, Dr. Darden, is a Bowflex expert since he works for the company that makes bowflex. He has worked out using all types of equipment, so I know his opinion has merit. Also, if you need to ask him a question, you can e-mail him and he does respond. Great Book!"
B00005X54S,We the Living,,A1J0NB7YI4TEDJ,Susan Taylor,2/2,5.0,1271548800,You Don't Want to Miss This!,"Ayn Rand is an excellent writer. But I didn't need this book to prove it to me since The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged have already made that obvious. It did take this book, though, to open my eyes to what living in 1920s Communist Russia was really like...and let me tell you, it was not walk in the park. Ayn Rand is one of those writers who will have so much an effect on you after you have read just a chapter of her book that you will begin to think in the way that she writes. You'll see. She makes you so much a part of the story that you are a poor Russian girl trying to find something worth holding onto...worth living for...in a world where everything is fleeting and nothing seems to matter. I highly recommend this novel to anyone interested in Communist Russia and/or anyone who wants to read a good romance that isn't the stereotypical cookie-cutter type. This is an overlooked gem. It is just as good, if not better than the works Ayn Rand is best known for."
B000BSFXQW,Jackalope,,AN2SQ37BVCATU,"E. S. Will ""a new leaf""",5/5,5.0,1067990400,"Silly, corny--lots of fun!","The sister duo who produced this book obviously had lots of fun--with word play, corny jokes, rhymes, and borrowed bits and pieces of classic tales-a fairy godrabbit and a magic mirror that admonishes, ""I don't just reflect, I need your respect."" They tack on a false ending plus an old-fashioned moral: ""Like yourself as you are.""They set out to tell the TRUE story of that unique Western creature--the jackalope, a jack rabbit with antelope horns--and pull it off wonderfully with an irreverent attitude and silly illustrations."
B000FTOWC8,On the Road,,A2XV6A32W193MM,M J Bobbett,2/4,4.0,953856000,Slightly dated feel takes the shine off this classic.,"'On the Road' has over the years become the definitive expression of disillusionment with society's expectectations. For those of us who at some point have struggled for direction or lost sight of our dreams it is likely to strike some chords.The two main characters of the book, Sal Paradise and Dean Moriarty, never truely win your heart in this book. Moriarty's exhuberance and desire to experience life to the full is tempered by his frustrating recklessness and somewhat fickle nature. Paradise, always eager to be infused by his companion's energy, tracks endlessly back and forth.At the end of the book you may be left a little confused as to what, if anything, our two heroes(?) have learnt or gained on their spiritual journeys.The book may feel a little dated with its 1950's American backdrop and did not have the atmosphere (the descriptions of the Jazz and Mambo music excepted) to rope me in. If you are a member of today's Generation X and are seeking a more modern perspective on discontentment and dropping out, perhaps Douglas Coupland may be more your style.In conclusion, this book would be fully worth three and a half stars. However, in the absence of half stars, it deserves the fourth for the inspiration it has given to successive generations of authors."
1573226475,The Psalms (Sacred Text),,,,4/8,3.0,885340800,Not What I expected,"After reading the poetic, almost mystical, Cloister Walk, I was disappointed. In Cloister Walk, Norris consistently uses the Grail Psalms in her quotes of Psalm verses. So, I was disappointed to find that these Psalms were based on the KJV. Alas, the Grail translation is out of print! Too bad -- that would have been my preference."
B00073AJ2E,Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book),,,,12/16,4.0,967161600,"A good book, if...","Every once in a while, an author publishes a really good book that actually has something to learn from it. Inevitably, teachers seize the oppurtunity and force kids to read it.I just came out of the 8th grade exhausted. My English class had spent over 6 months on Johnny Tremain! My teacher practically ripped the book apart, so that every single one of her students could recite the 47 themes in Chapter 5 (such as a routine to to the well actually being a lifelong journey of hope). This teacher had been using Johnny Tremain so long, she could actually RECITE THE FIRST CHAPTER! And the chapters are not very small at all.Anyway, after school was over, I picked up my copy again. I was hooked. It was actually fun reading the book when I didn't have to note the conflicts between Johnny and Rab in Chapter 9. The story is very well written, and it teaches important lessons about life today as well as in the 18th century. My only gripe is that it seems that Esther Forbes tried to write a book that was pretty much a compilation of every other coming of age story. People don't have &quot;growing up realizations&quot;, girl troubles, freindship disputes, family trouble, a burnt hand, and a national revolution all in the same week!"
0689319908,"The Realms of the Gods (Immortals, The)",,,,0/0,5.0,1044144000,This is a great book!!!,"I first started reading Wild Magic, and as another reveiwer put it, I got ""addicted"" to Tamora Pierce. Her books are like the best books in the whole world.The blossoming romance between Diane and Numair really gives a sence of humanity and depth in the book which it otherwise would not have had. Tamora Pierce developes a great plot that leaves you wishing for more, and at the same time you are also satisfied.I wish that Rikash hadn't died, because he was a nice reminder that not all things that you think are bad are actually bad.Tamora Pierce also allows you to confuse the books within a series with each other, which I think is the mark of a good writer. She uses continuity throughout the series, so if I say something that belongs in another book, sorry.Again, I thought that the romance between Diane and Numair was one of the best things that she could have done, because the plot is a litte less humanity oriented than the other books in the series.If I am discouraging anyone from buying this book, I don't mean to, so just in case I am, you really should buy this book. It is a great conlusion to the end of the series, but it is also a really great book by itself.-Mauvie"

Some websites online recommended this Princeton Review book, so I decided to give it a shot, so I wouldn't be testing blind. The book is very good at explaining the process, and explaining each of the sections. It has plenty of review problems, which are similar in difficulty to the ones on the test itself. I read through the entire book (which is much smaller than my official SAT review book, I might add) and took one practice exam.On the day of the exam, I felt confident in my abilities, and wasn't shocked by the exam; in fact, I found it much easier than the SAT. My scores reflected that; even though I only have a 1410 on the SAT, my ACT score (first time!) was a 34, including a perfect score of 36 for the science section and a near-perfect 35 on the critical reading section.

Of course the book would be no fun if these two fell in love at first sight again and so through the process of cloning we have one couple living out two completely different lifetime relationships...... or does it just seem like one couple---that's what is fun to decide. If twins have such a strong mental tie to their sibling, imagine what it would be for a Clone and his gene donor. Shared memories through Telepathic connection from beyond the grave.....I also enjoyed the life and times of the hippies; their adventure made for a great story and it was great to take a 150 year trip with the Grateful Dead.Kudos for the fantastic poetry--- it was not only beautifully written, but it lent to their story by setting the mood for each chapter. The entries from Sunny's diaries is what gives this book a heartbeat; it is especially touching.The author does a wonderful job telling the love story. He has made the characters down to earth enough to make the loftiness of their love believable and bearable for the reader. As you get caught up in the love the hippies share, you'll feel for the struggle the Clones--- particularly the male Clone--- goes thru. But they find their own way once they leave the old ways behind and by book's end there are new beginnings on the horizon for all..... Including a sequel.......Like a fine piece of machinery, all the parts of this book work. The author has command of the direction of the story so you are always in the flow with the wind at your back.Favorite Part- When Flare and Sunny get hitched on the pot farm while the State Troopers are raiding the place.Why 4 Stars? Because Das Kapital is a 5 Star book...."
1567183026,Signs of Mental Illness: An Astrological and Psychiatric Breakthrough,,A1KK6NSLFHD1P8,Steven,0/0,5.0,1356480000,Absolutely Brilliant!,There is very little material available about the use of astrology for determining challenges such as mental illness. I read the Amazon reviews last night for this book and was surprised that one person gave it a poor rating because it was difficult to understand. Another person gave it a poor rating even though she had 20 plus years of experience with astrology. I have worked with hermetic astrology for many years and found this book to be an outstanding piece of work! I can only presume that the person who had 20 plus years of astrology meant that the he or she had been reading horoscopes in a newspaper.I am hoping that Mitchell goes ahead with projects mentioned in the back of the book: astrological markers for creative genius etc. I honestly feel that the people who have left poor ratings for this book don't have a sufficient understanding of astrology to understand the content.

In this quirky autobiographical piece Sedaris tackles everything from a speech therapist who is out to correct every lisp in the boys with homosexual tendacies, to his galavanting in Paris where he visits all the movie theatres but none of the tourist attractions, to his prank playing sister who finds it amusing to create shocking situations (she yells out ""good luck beating that rape charge David"" right before he steps out of his subway car).Some of his stories border on the absurd but his true talent is for finding humorous twists and perspectives on the mundane parts of life that many of us have perhaps pondered in a similar fashion but never had the true courage to vocalize. I read half of this book out loud to my husband and he and I were both gasping for breath as we shook with laughter. Read just one chapter and I dare you to put it down. This is one of those books I know I will return to again and again because it isn't a linear plot but a collection of great moments that you want to share with those around you.My only regret is that it took me this long to pick up one of his books.

If it's humor you're looking for, then this is a funny, comical book to read with fast-paced, pinpoint dialogue (similar to the slapstick humor in Zuckers/Abrahams/Zuckers movies &quot;Airplane!&quot; or &quot;The Naked Gun&quot;). BUT FUNNY IS SUCH A GROSS UNDERSTATEMENT. Catch 22 is rich with social and political symbolisim, which means if you're looking for something deeper than a &quot;good laugh&quot; there is plenty here to keep you busy thinking for a long time. Overall, I found Catch 22 to be a story of hope. That no matter how ridiculous or impossible the obstacles in front of you appear, you can conquer them with belief in yourself and a plan of attack."

B000BHA3SG,The Debt Threat : How Debt Is Destroying the Developing World,,A1686H7Q24XZ3E,Vincent Toolan,27/28,5.0,1098748800,"Blueprint for change, endorsed by rock stars","Few exhortations to action manage to blend a detailed objective analysis of the facts; a practical, well thought-out agenda for change; and the true passion that comes of moral certainty. Dr Hertz's book somehow pulls it off.Her central case is that developing country debt is the legacy of bad decisions - bad on the parts of the lenders, and of the borrowers. The consequences are awful at the human level, on a massive scale, just as Bono eloquently described at the Labour Party conference. IOU goes some way down the same path, successfully mixing the pure statistics of poverty with anecdotes of uneducated children, needlessly untreated HIV/AIDS sufferers, and women forced into prostitution. One of this book's strengths, however, is that it brings to the fore something far less obvious: namely, that the consequences of debt are malicious for the lenders in the rich world too. The debt quagmire entrenches much of the world's unrealised economic potential in a spiral of corruption, dampening demand for western goods and limiting investment, breeding ill-feeling towards lender nations, and ultimately contributing to the existence of failed states in which terrorists can thrive.She goes on to explain exactly how to break the spiral, and anticipates and overcomes the practical objections. In a nutshell, she proposes applying strict criteria to debt relief, and an ingenious series of controls to ensure that money freed up benefits people rather than corrupt politicians.Dr Hertz's breathless writing style conveys her passion for the subject rather well. Colloquialisms, run-on sentences, and a strange eye for the physical characteristics of her protagonists all give the sense of being on the receiving end of an intense face-to-face monologue rather than reading a dry book about development economics. Male characters ""probably used to be good looking""; women are ""hose clad"". But the facts and figures to buttress the case are never far behind. If there is perhaps one area in which she stretches the case a little too far, it is in the impact of debt on the environment. The reader gets the sense that because both debt and climate change are important, there must somehow be a causal link. But this section does little do dilute the impact of the whole.All in all, an engaging and important piece of work that deserves the plaudits. As Bob Geldof says: ""everyone should read this book""."

This guy outstrips the limits and is really satanic and cold hearted and even sadistic. I never could accept the romance between him and Leonie. There is no gentleness in him. In addition, she is nineteen and he is in his forties. His son in Devil's Cub is better, wild, dangerous, but with more warmth and consideration, more emotional and reachable than his father.I was also taken aback when reading this book for the first time in high school by the snobbishness. Lower class characters are physically coarse, snub nosed, large pored, big footed. The Duke knows Leonie is an aristo because she is fine boned, small nostriled, delicate, small footed. Usually this kind of thing passes as part of the genre. But this was a little too pronounced."

Self-help is the technology of the humanities and human sciences, and _Mean Genes_ catapults biology into the vangaurd of self-help technology.I've always been suspect of self-help. Just because that helped you, why would it help me? In many cases there doesn't seem to be any reason to follow advice based the kind of personal experience often used to develop self-help techniques.Not only do Burnham and Phelan discuss actual research into human and animal behavior, they also piece together the forgotten history and physical bases of many of our most recalcitrant weaknesses. Some of their simple revelations about greed, sex, gluttony, and the like, speak to the very nature of the personal evils that we faced down (or succumb to) day-in and day-out.If self-knowledge is half of the battle for happiness, _Mean Genes_ brings us at least 1/3 of the way toward eternal bliss."

B0007ECLJM,Wide Sargasso Sea,,A29NUB3P6YIWZG,lazza,4/5,4.0,1223078400,prequel to Jane Eyre intriques...,"'Wide Sargasso Sea' is certainly an interesting read. Although a prequel to 'Jane Eyre', it can be read on its own merit. The story is about a rather disturbed young woman in the West Indies and her husband who both tries to understand and escape from her. The author captures the time period (1830s) perfectly and has obviously researched the lifestyle and the language of the local people. She is also a brilliant writer; her prose and characterizations are of a high caliber. Yet since much of the book is written in the first person of a stressed, emotionally unstable woman, I found it sometimes difficult to catch all the subtle nuances. Thankfully there are appendices in the back of the book which proved most helpful.Bottom line: a very different, at times difficult, but very remarkable piece of literature."

If you liked Pride and Prejudice, then you'll love Emma.However, I like Austen's darker, heavier books, like Persuasion and Mansfield Park.Emma is long, far longer than S&S; or Persuasion, but it's also fluffier. Emma is rich, very quite rich, so she doesn't have the problems of the Bennett girls in P&P; or the girls in S&S;, or even the gentler money problems of the ladies in Persuasion.Emma is Jane's fantasy, what she might have done if she were rich.If you like Jane Austen, you'll like Emma.If you like Jane Austen's sharp, stinging wit, try one of her others.V."

B000KNFA8O,History of Western Philosophy,,A1BNM2PQE62HIM,Justus Pendleton,7/7,4.0,1004572800,excellent introduction,"It seems that the previous reviews cover most of the praise and objections that can be offered. I will reiterate those that deserve special emphasis. Many others have pointed out Russell's biases. As some have noted they are hardly hidden and quite clear to the reader. zencoyote above points out that this is only to be expected. Do we really believe that someone, anyone, can write a history of anything and not let their biases influence what events are given prominence and which are not? Russell's biases are clear (he often points them out to the reader himself) and add color to the text. If you want to read a history with a different set of biases then find a different author.The strengths of this book lie in the first two thirds -- dealing with the ancient Greeks and the medieval scholastics. When it reaches the modern age it begins to lose some of its brilliance. The selection of topics is curious -- Byron is included but Voltaire is not, Dewey is present but not Kierkegaard. A strangely large amount of space is devoted to Locke and I couldn't help but feel that he didn't do justice to Hegel's views (even though I think I am in general agreement with Russell about them).The most interesting aspects of this book are that Russell attempts to show philosophy in the context of society at large and provides a criticism of the various philosophies. This criticism is especially useful for a novice."

Yet through the elements of water and blood and her ever present symbol of love and hope, the rose, she weaves a tale takes you to another plane where a ordinary old black overcoat becomes a symbol of evil and transforms itself into a symbol of resolution, forgiveness and finally an uneasy solice of a lost soul. In the River King, Ms. Hoffman weaves a tale of past sorrows and cruelties and brings them together in a single resolution. Her clever interweaving of the characters lives is ingenious, yet strangley uncomplicated. You never walk away from an Alice Hoffman book without looking at a rose or an old overcoat without wondering what secret it may hold. Ms. Hoffman gets highest honors for taking us away from the daily commute, the daily grind of working. I only wish it would last longer."

I'd reccomend this type of book to those who don't mind a political conflict now and then, who like romance and history, and who want to have a look back in time at what life was like back then.

Yau ""Voracious reader""",2/3,4.0,1073088000,1984 or 2004?,"Eric Blair's 1984 is not only his finest work but also one of the most influential and provocative books of our time. The work obviates to us to full actuality how the world had evolved for the worse during the dark period from 1932 to 1949. Winston Smith and O'Brien are the most important characters whose keystone dialogue raises alert for the prospect of human future.Prophecy or Caution?While we might prefer to interpret ""1984"" as a precautionary tale or some social warning, bloodshed, warfare, massive torture and murder, not to mention Stalin's cruelty, the Nazi mechanized techniques of organized massacre, the Cambodian, the Iranian and the Iraqi, the North Korean, and all the other countless horrors, have inevitably to a certain degree changed ""1984"" from caution to warning, further elevating the work to a 20th century prophecy.Despair about Future of ManA sense of hopelessness about the future of man hovers over the book. In a way ""1984"" is an expression of such a hopeless mood about the bleak future of man. It warns readers that unless the course of history (and leaderships) changes men all over the world will forfeit most of their human qualities and become soulless automatons without being aware of the depravity.In the Winston Smith-O'Brien dialogue, ""Imagine a boot stamping on the human face-forever"" might have exaggerated the current state of human soulness. The 20th century history has confirmed and fulfilled dehumanized practices as mentioned in ""1984"" like 24/7 surveillance of all sounds, activities, and conversations; deprivation of freedom of speech, penitence for thought crime and wiping out of existence and memory and thus forfeiting any way to make appeal to future. For example, a Party member lived from birth to death under the eye of the Thought Police. Even when he was alone he could never be sure he was alone. Wherever he may be, he could be inspected without warning and without knowing that he was being inspected.The Party tacitly encouraged prostitution as such outlets for instincts that could not be altogether suppressed. This unforgivable crime was promiscuity between Party members in order to remove all pleasure from sexual act. Even to his wife, a Party member was expected to have no private emotions and no respites from enthusiasm. A real romantic love affair was all it took to crumple the Party. Desire was deemed thought crime, which entailed death.The Party saw that it was not infallible and that all its belief rested on the omnipotent Big Brother. It therefore called for an unwearying, moment-to-moment flexibility in the treatment of facts-alteration of the past and rewrite of history in order to wipe out existence of certain human beings and historical facts. It was not merely that speeches, statistics, and records of every kind must be constantly brought up to date in order to show that the predictions of the Party were in all cases accurate. It was also that no change of doctrine or in political alignment could ever be admitted. Whatever the Party held to be truth was truth. It was impossible to see reality except by looking through the eyes of the Party.Notwithstanding the Party contrived to have its way and imbued the belief in people, how could the Party control people's memory? The Party had wiped out most of the older generation during the great purges and the few who survived had long ago been terrified into complete intellectual surrender (sounds familiar like the Chinese Cultural Revolution?) When memory failed and written records were falsified, the claim of the Party to have improved the conditions of human life had got to be accepted, because there did not exist, and never again could exist, any standard against which it could be tested.""1984"" is meant to be read as a warning, an exhortation, and not so much prophesy. However exaggerated and haunting the negative utopia is being depicted, the book is a startling work of an imaginary world that is convincing. 4.0 stars.2004 (4)"

I also have ADD, which makes the transfer of information from the eye to the brain harder than most people. For this reason, I require visual representations of things to help me understand it better (written words confuse me sometimes).I have confered with massage therapists and sports med docs about what to do about my sore back, messed up sholder (from swimming) and my stiff neck and shoulders (from heavy knapsack relative to my size, as well as due to stress and sitting at my computer). The information didn't stick, and the routines abandonded after a week. This book has made it more fun to stretch!I have looked at other books which have actual pictures of people stretching, but didn't have the area shaded where I should feel the stretch. When you stretch, that is what is important - where you feel it. This book get the job done fast and simple. After reading the introductory pages, now I feel a stiff or sore muscle somewhere, I pull out this book, look up a body part and get myself into the position. If I don't feel the stretch in the shaded area, I try adjusting a little, and read the paragraph. The sequence of stretches at the end of each section is great as well, since I have a hard time deciding what order to do things in. With this book it is all laid out for those people who like (and need) routine.The quick reference summaries at the end are great. This ensures that people will be more likely to stick to the routine if they have a 'program' made for them already. The benefits of having a regualr strethcing program has been widely documented in many sports articles, medical articles and such. The olympic swim coaches where I work are all for stretching for and hour and a half four times a week for the athletes.My one major qualm is the section called &quot;Blue Collar Stretches&quot;. I think it should be corrected to something else more politically correct. My one minor qualm is that the summary pictographs do not have the shaded area on them. It would've been great if they had the shaded area to make an even better reference.As mentioned in other reviews, the book is good for the average person who isn't into a super stretching regimen, but rather for the person who would like guidance in knowing what kind of sports require what kind of stretching. People who just want to start feeling more relaxed and good about doing so without pressure of all the technicalities and long muscle names will love this book. It is not intimidating or condescending, it encourages everyone to slow down and carefully stretch, at any level, at any age.I didn't know how to stretch a particular muscle in my thigh, and friends weren't able to find a stretch either. The runner guy who comes water running while I lifeguard didn't even know either! I was greatful when I foudn that this book had this uncommon stretch. I was impressed!!I am so pleased that I already recommended it on a triathlete message board!The guy in the ski hat with the 70's party hairstyle is all good. Is it just me, or is he wearing those old skool athletic short shorts?Go and buy this book! You will be glad the next time you wake up in the morning after a hard workout the day before and find your ________ is sore. Happy stretching everyone!"

But at the time this book was written, it was not common to focus a novel on a pair of lovers with the understanding that those lovers were, in fact, jerks. The way Bronte alternately panders to 'romance' conventions with craggy Heathcliff and wayward Catherine and then spits in the face of those conventions by showing the effeminate, willowy Edgar to be the closest thing to a decent adult character in the book is refreshing for those of us who are tired of the dominance of the alpha male.In passing, I must also mention that between the stormy moors, the borderline necrophilia, and the grandiose tooth-gnashing spurned-lover angst, this is a very goth book, which never hurts from my point of view.The other part of the equation is that (despite the protestations of certain reviewers) Bronte keeps the suspense high throughout the book. Between worrying about the fate of young Cathy, waiting for the ghost to make another appearance, and eagerly anticipating the moment when Heathcliff gets his, there's hardly a slack moment.I must say that the ending was not, in my opinion, as strong as it could have been, but I'll speak of it no more so as not to spoil it. Hence, only four stars."

0754054373,Brave New World,,A3ON59TXAULJPN,B. VanPelt,1/1,5.0,1354320000,Scary and well-written,"This is another one of those ""dystopian"" novels that seemed popular in the first half of the 20th century. It fits in perfectly with novels like ""1984"" and ""Fahrenheit 451"". Of those three novels, I believe this came first. The funny thing about this book is that the future doesn't seem completely terrible, unlike the latter two novels, although I might compare the entire population of the earth (in ""Brave New World"") to the proletariats (in ""1984"").See, in this novel nobody seems to be unhappy at all. They are literally born to do the jobs they will perform for their entire adult lives, and love those jobs. Each person is born into a certain ""caste"" and they are happy to be in that caste, and envy no one in any other castes. The lowest of the low are referred to as epsilon - minus, semi-morons. This is interesting, as epsilon is a common mathematical number that defines how much error a function may allow. In this book, the epsilons (as a general class), represent the lowest possible mental and social state of humanity.Of course, their are more intelligent people as well. The castes are, from highest to lowest: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon. That's quite a bit like a typical grading system of A, B, C, D, F. As you can imagine, the Alphas are the smartest, and the list goes down from there. But the thing is, each caste member is truly satisfied by their caste membership. The novel makes a pretty logical reason why the caste members are happy with their lot in life.Sex is treated in a completely pragmatic fashion, and emotions are almost completely subdued.With the help of a super narcotic, the populace is able to enjoy life and extravagant recreation - devoid of all sadness and driven by a natural tendency to ""consume"". Everything is in place to allow a person to go through life almost without any spikes in emotion. Even death is a conditioned response.The missing element in this picture is humanity. Essentially, those in control have tried their best to keep any highs and lows within a certain amount of error (epsilon). The central question is the running of civilization vs. the individual spirit. It seems that, to keep a civilization going, we need to make certain sacrifices individually - and it's easy to make those sacrifices when we don't realize that we are making those sacrifices.However, there are about 5 major characters, and I think each one represents a different amount of humanity - or at least different levels of humanity. In this version of the future, it's possible to step outside the bounds of what is acceptable, but you are not doomed if you do so. Instead, you are offered a quite reasonable accommodation.Aldous Huxley offers extremely complex characters, but each is allowed to act within a certain epsilon of ranges - he wrote in very delicate shades of meaning. In fact, I'm pretty certain that I've never read an author who has presented me with more ""gray areas"" within the thinking of each character. Mr. Huxley is a very deep and complicated author who was ahead of his time. Those novels ""1984"" and ""Fahrenheit 451"" presented dystopias that were easily regarded as undesirable, whereas ""Brave New World"" presents a future that is not so obviously flawed. In fact, my wife asserts that this future was actually desirable - but she's a bleeding heart socialist, so that doesn't surprise me. ""Brave New World"" does, in my mind, present a more deviously dystopian future than the other two novels. I believe each of the major characters is meant to ask, in total, all of the questions we, the readers, might have.In the end, this novel was gripping and a serious page turner. Every night, it inspired a great debate between my wife and me, and its overall game plan is one of subtlety instead of shock.I'll bet that, after you read the novel, you will be able to spot this particular plot in many movies - particularly ""The Matrix""."

As I read it I felt like Toad was a `Prodigal Son', who came back only far enough to receive acceptance, then returned to his bad habits till he was in trouble again.It reminded me much of myself, playing at being Christian before really giving Christ all areas of my life. Like Toad I would repent, but then not really change.Rat was wise and resourceful, Mole was tender and caring and awe-full like a child yet also very wise. Badger is like a wise mature old mentor or guide, sent to give direction, and lead one to find one's own purpose in life.Yet the mix of Animal and Human society just did not make sense to me. It felt like a badly planned Narnia novel. It did not explain how the animal and human worlds came to interact and share a language or culture.But over all it was a fun read even if dry in some spots.(First written as Journal Reading Notes in 1999.)"

For example, Mr Klein claims Hillary was a lesbian - this allegation has been totally debunked by her so called lesbian partner, who was nothing more than a close friend of Hillary's in college. There are so many allegations in this book that at the end you wonder why a publishing house would even consider getting this book out. Unfortunately, in these times that we live in, I'm not surprised one bit, and it is a shame where this money-driven country is heading to.I'm no fan of Hillary Clinton, I only respect as a person, and I believe people should not have their reputations dragged into the mud by liars and profiteers like Mr Klein and his publisher."

Yes, she was in love with Rochester, but still, this is a girl who's presented as one who can hold her own and is not easily dominated. So I finally gave the DVD to the library.But I decided that before I write Charlotte Bronte off as not my kind of author, I'd read her book to see if it makes more sense than that depiction of it.

Groovy... as they might of said in London several years AFTER this was first broadcast.The Great Bank Robbery rounds out this collection and ultimately the idea of a botched robbery is fertile ground for the style of stream of consciousness comedy this group excelled at.There are so many of these things available it's hard to recommend one beyond another but I'd have to say that volumes 8, 9 and 15 are pretty much my faves."

B0007DKPJ6,The Pathfinder,,A3NCKDPCAUOD4T,nto62,4/4,4.0,1052784000,Upon the inland sea...........,"In the fourth installment of the Leatherstocking Tales, Cooper introduces a nautical theme upon the surface and along the shores of Lake Ontario. The Pathfinder is ultimately a love story tinged with the conspiracy of treason, though it takes no extra-sensory perception to uncover the traitor long before he is exposed in the book. Cap, a grizzled saltwater veteran, accompanies his niece to visit her father stationed at the British outpost of Fort Oswego, NY. Once there, the two become embroiled in the confrontation between England, France, and their Native American allies for control of the lake. Cap is dismissive of landlubbers and ""freshwater ponds"", such as he describes Ontario, setting the stage for his mind to be turned by the derring-do of inland waterman, Jasper Western. Indeed, Cap is so outspoken in his contempt for the ways of his new found associates, that he becomes somewhat of an annoyance to the reader. Cooper chose to give the character little in the way of redeeming qualities nearly spoiling the pleasure one takes in Cap's ultimate and grudging respect for the wilderness and the men who master it. Such a thoroughly boorish character simply creates no emotional connection. But, Cap isn't guilty of treason. You'll spot the traitor shortly after he appears.The Pathfinder is formulaic, utterly predictable, and, at times, almost childlike in substance, but throughout, as in all other Leatherstocking Tales, radiates the simple goodness, manly deportment, and rustic charm of Nathaniel Bumppo. Indeed, Bumppo as a character is so masterfully wrought that Cooper could place him in a melon patch for the duration of a book and still manage to eke out a classic. Having previously read The Pioneers, The Last of the Mohicans, and The Prairie, I find The Pathfinder the weaker of the four, but fourth in favor in this wonderful series of stories isn't any black mark. Indeed, it qualifies The Pathfinder as yet another loveable yarn from the pen of James Fenimore Cooper. 4+ stars."

This is certainly not as good as that book, but it's still darn good (especially for a first novel). As with ""Warbreaker,"" Sanderson has come up with something unique as the driving force behind a book's universe. Ditto in that the book is entirely self-contained, is well-described, and has several unforeseen and clever plot twists.My biggest problem with the book is the pacing: the first half of the book drags. There are a lot of things being developed, but not too much actually happening. Then, at the midpoint, things pick up dramatically (and even more so at about the 3/4 point). Also, there are one or two places where the main characters seem to have brain failure and fail to grasp something when all the pieces have finally been laid out in front of them. Finally (and most trivially), for no reason I can come up with, I had a tough time keeping the characters' names straight. The names are sufficiently different from each other and, for the most part, even follow a cultural naming scheme. But, I was constantly trying to keep name attached to character.Regardless of those gripes, this is still a very good book and I rate it at 4 stars out of 5."

My rating is more on content, and because the last chapter made me so frustrated (which, once again, could just be good writing) that I had to offer an angle.Ramona's parents are distant and clueless. In my view, sometimes ""spirited"" children just need some loving, strong absolutes and swift, fair punishment; neither of which Ramona's parents were prepared to offer. So, everyone suffered for a week trying to figure out what decision this 5-yr-old was going to make, when it could have been over in one day. I don't know about you, but it's never okay in my house to kick your bedroom wall...not when you're happy, not when you're mad... so the fact that there was no stronger guidance for Ramona here bugged me.Having said that, I totally understand that this is a fictional, fun book & should not be taken too seriously. It should, though, be explored together, so you don't suddenly get more tantrums from your kids and wonder why. Also, SPOILER ALERT for younger children who still undeniably believe in the tooth fairy... that is brought into question in one of the chapters, so just be aware. Otherwise, cute read."

I was rather attached to each of the characters by the final book though and was pleased with the ending overall, I just feel it could have been racier and faster paced. I still give this book five stars together with the other two. I don't think I've ever read such an enjoyable book in my life and I am so pleased to have read it.

These three tales are found unabridged in this Dover edition (2000) reprint, The Suicide Club.The Suicide Club is based on an imaginative, ghastly premise, a secret club dedicated to facilitating the suicide of its own members. In the first tale, The Story of the Young Man with the Cream Tarts, Stevenson not only fully develops this macabre concept, but also introduces his two protagonists, Prince Florizel of Bohemia and his personal aide, Colonel Geraldine, that play key roles in these three stories as well as in later stories.Unfortunately, although the two sequels, Story of the Physician and the Saratoga Trunk, and The Adventures of the Hansom Cab, initially are suspenseful, the endings seemingly fizzle out, and neither story quite achieves its promise. Nonetheless, these three stories in combination still rate 3.5 to 4 stars and will appeal to fans of Robert Louis Stevenson.Point of interest: The film, The Suicide Club, was released in 2000; Roger Corman was the producer, Rachel Samuels was director, and the actors include Jonathan Pryce, David Morrissey, Paul Bettany, and Catherine Siggins (in the film version there is a female member of the exclusive suicide club).

I'm not crazy about the &quot;case histories&quot; either, another review mentioned them I think, but it's a minor qualm and they do serve their purpose. Overall the writing is clear and characterized by a modesty that gives the book a cozy and inviting feel; but it does this without becoming inappropriately simplistic or trite, taking care that the reader does not fall victim to many of the common misunderstandings of Buddhism, and Zen thought. A reader who is already very familiar with Buddhism would likely find this book refreshing and pleasant, while a reader who isn't as familiar might find it a very profound and, due to the tie-in with psychotherapy, relatively practical introduction to the subject indeed. I knew only a little about Buddhism when I picked up this book, and the book served to stimulate and propel that interest greatly. All in all, an intelligent, interesting, and accessible book.

His discouragement is palpable, but unavoidable given the growth in human population upon which he bases his premise of future problems. Basically he states the world cannot feed and clothe 6-7 billion people no matter the scientific advances humankind enjoy. We just passed 6 billion.A pretty good read. He's not overly pushy but rather contemplative about how his story parallels history. Be sure to read his story prior to this re-visitation."

I was hooked on his writings since the first time I read his book, which is this one. When I first finished reading this book some years ago, it changed my view in English literature altogether. What struck me was the stark honesty and reality in his writings. Never had I come across a writer who was as honest as Carver. He tells his stories the way life really is, without trying to twist, sensationalise or glamourise it. He tells stories about people like us. In fact, his stories are about us and the people around us.Don't be fooled by the length of his short stories, his shortest pieces like 'Neighbors' and 'Fat' are among his best (though I can't really point out any that is not his best anyway) because it tells so much in so little words.Another startling thing about Carver's stories is that it can relate to people everywhere in the world though he writes about Americans."
B000K18MPO,Book of Saladin,,AYQY3RB33F4J6,3rdeadly3rd,35/35,5.0,1125792000,A Superb Piece of Work,"Tariq Ali's ""The Book of Saladin"" is the second in his ""quintet"" about Islam. Don't let that put you off, though, as there is no set order to read the series in - no characters carry over from one book to the next and the continuity throughout is in fact the relationship between Islam and other religions during times of upheaval.As the name suggests, ""The Book of Saladin"" is about that famous adversary of the Crusaders, the Kurdish Yusuf Salah-ad-din Ibn Ayyub who founded the Ayyubid dynasty of Egypt. The basis of this novel is that Saladin has hired a Jewish writer to record his life and times as he leads the battle to re-take Jerusalem from the ""Franj"" (Crusaders, one of the many Arabic words used in the book and explained in the glossary).The reader is therefore treated to a series of stories-within-stories, and knowing Ali's sense of humour (he is an electric public speaker) the parallel to the ""Arabian Nights"" is probably more than a fortuitous coincidence. Our narrator leads his own life over the years of his acquaintance with Saladin, along with its attendant highs and lows while recording Saladin's memories and hearing stories from his loyal retainers and members of his harem. All of these strands combine and separate in various ways to create a narrative experience quite hard to describe in words.While the novel ends on a somewhat pessimistic note, this is probably only to be expected, as this was hardly a glorious time for either side involved in the conflict.While certain characters - particularly Maimonides, who makes a cameo appearance - suffer from being relatively two-dimensional, the central characters are all eminently believable. In the case of Saladin, this is quite a feat as the volume of ink devoted to him over the centuries is quite spectacular and separating the man from the myth is a difficult task. The reader will almost certainly find themselves cheering when the Sultan wins a victory, whether on the battlefield or in the court chambers.Ali's eye for detail is also deployed to great effect here. Ayyubid Cairo is evoked lovingly, as are the other locations which play important roles in the plot. Similarly, while the court intrigues of the time are confusing at best, Ali makes a noble attempt at simplifying things for the casual reader without an interest in the politics of the time. The frequent use of Arabic terms for events and places can be disconcerting to the reader with no background in the history of the region, however the glossary will help to overcome that - and the terms become easy to understand soon enough.His sense of humour, too, plays an important part in this novel. Ali has a particular fondness for what can sometimes be described as ""dirty jokes"", as his description of Richard I of England clearly demonstrates. His dialogue between a heretical (Cathar, I believe) crusader and Saladin is hilarious, even to the extent of offensive comments being made in perfect Latin.In short, this is a book which can be heartily recommended. For newcomers to Ali's writings, this is as good a place to start as any - possibly better than some other offerings, at that. This is also a great demonstration of ""how the other half lives"", in that the humanity of the ""saracens"" during the crusades is often overlooked. Knowledge of that humanity is, in my opinion, something we need now more than ever."

It extrapolates what is wrong with the deaf people today and what causes them to experience the indignity, disrespect, and so forth from the hearing people. To this day, they are still disenfranchised...A Texas senator who pushed for 185-million dollar fund to rebuild almost entire Texas School of the Deaf snapped back at the group who thought he was insane to push for rebuilding the deaf institute when it was popular trend to close the special institutes for the people with disabilities.

If you know nothing about the topic, read it, because it will save you from the pitfalls that have brough on most of modern economic errors.

Like all great books, it is a simple, concise, yet essential single lesson in economics.

0440155797,Mengele,,,,11/33,5.0,1001376000,"More Mengele, Less Mossad!","This book focusses on Mengele's life as a fugitive, giving just a little background information and very few details (from third parties with questionable motives) about his work at Auschwitz. The reader is expected to believe the stories of a Frankenstein-esque mad scientist creating mutants to advance the Master Race. That is the only point where the reader's intellect is insulted, and it is a low point. Too much is said about the goings-on at the Israeli Mossad, if I wanted to read about the quarreling of some top secret jews I would have bought another book! This is by no means &quot;the complete story,&quot; as outside sources are often quoted- &quot;victims&quot; and doctors forced to work under him are hardly impartial sources for information. The most intriguing part of the book comes not from the authors or witnesses, but from Dr. Josef Mengele himself. His diary excerpts are very revealing to his personality, or at least how he thought of himself. Forget the phony Hitler Diaries, the real Mengele Diaries would make for better reading. It is a shame he was forced to spend 30 years of his life languishing in South America, as he had the brilliance to do anything he put his mind to. Through this book the preconception of the talentless Nazi butcher whose ideas and research methods were &quot;worthless&quot; is disproved by Mengele's more-than-apparent genius. The authors try to paint him as a bad scientist and lousy philosopher, but fail miserably. The light of intelligence shines through in Dr. Josef Mengele's own words, which are sprinkled throughout the book.If you're at all curious about what life is really like for a &quot;Nazi war criminal&quot; in hiding, this is a good book for that. But if a concise biography of a &quot;Nazi war criminal&quot; devoid of any mediocre Freudian psychoanalysis is your cup of tea, look elsewhere."

071674161X,How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science,,,,0/1,4.0,959385600,a bunch of bright ideas,"As usual, Shermer covers of hodgepodge of related topics in this work as has been his style in previous writings. The subject matter is, in a word--nebulous. God, religion, belief, politically incorrect topics in an age where variety of ideas about these topics abounds. Basically, Shermer puts forth the thesis of an evolutionarily evolved human pattern-seeking system which compels us to find meaning in the endless static. This conceptualization is broad enough to explain the basics of religious though, as well as our ability to be taken advantage of by frauds masquerading as scientists--a subject that Shermer, the high priest of skepticism, is quite familiar with. In the end, the book as a whole is an intriguing read, however it could have been improved with better editing. The middle chapters contain loosely tied together concepts and often get off-topic. However, Shermer makes up for this by writing a brilliant summary (and defense) of Stephen Jay Gould's writings on science and religion in the last chapter.Shermer believes that the question for God in insoluble and therefore sees nothing wrong with religion and belief in the numinous. However, as a skeptic, Shermer, in other writings, espouses the basic tenet that one should believe the simplest scientific explanation for a given phenomenon. From a purely scientific viewpoint, God is unnecessary and therefore a superfluous concept. However, Shermer's willingness to allow for an &quot;expection to the rule&quot; in this instance may be viewed as slightly hypocritical. Nevertheless, while logically inconsistent, I thing Shermer comes to the right conclusion."

It turned out to be even better than I expected. I was worried that the detail and depth that this book went into would be too much for him, but it seems that at his age, the more info, the better. He requests this book almost nightly, and loves when I change the names in the book so that it's appropriate for our family. As a mom, I really appreciate that this book covers a lot of what will be really happening, so that nothing really comes as a surprise to him once baby gets here - things like, the umbilical cord scab, baby crying, breastfeeding, sponge baths... etc. It also gives a thorough background of baby's development, which is a key concept to understanding that at some point, Mom's belly will soon give way to a sibling. The author isn't vague nor does she use alternate terms for things, or attempt to ""dumb it down"" at all. Thanks to the great pictures, even the most complicated things like ""umbilical cord"" is pretty easy for my son to understand.

A fascinating story that actually allows Jason Voorhees to develop as a real character is almost killed by the horrible writing of Paul Woods. We follow Jason and a serial killer and his greatest admirer named Wayne Sanchez (who is a carbon copy of real life Richard Ramirez the Nighstalker) as they lead a rebellion in hell that unleashes the worst psychos in history on the East coast of the U.S. Woods can handle the parts of the book that focus on the villains and both Sanchez and Jason himself are great but the parts involving the heroes, a group of college kids that go to school near Crystal Lake where the portal from hell is located, are just terrible. I know this writer if from England but the dialogue between these American kids is so unrealistic it's laughable and not a one of them is particularly likeable or interesting. Basically, 50% of this book is really good and 50% is kind of okay. Worth reading for people that are interested in Jason as a character and not as a stoic villain.I'd also like to note that this book has the most typos of any published work I've ever read."

It paints a vivid picture - with a bit of purple prose here and there - of life in Puritan times and the trials of Hester Prynne, condemned by the village for adultery. There was a movie made from this book with Demi Moore and it was pretty good, but the book has a lot in it that the movie does not reveal.I'm just glad I don't live in Puritan times - it was hard for EVERYONE, especially women."
B0007BXQ8K,The sheltering sky,,,,7/18,2.0,875577600,"A major motion picture??? You're kidding, right?","For a man who has spent decades living in Morocco, Paul Bowles does a poor job of bringing the Sahara Desert to life in his novel, The Sheltering Sky. After reading the book, I was honestly surprised to find that he lived in and around the Sahara for so many years. I had already forgiven this shortcoming of the author as a valiant attempt by a non-African when I was disappointed to find that the opposite was the case. Bowles' limited powers of description are not a result of his life experience.The Sheltering Sky lacks structure and character development, is rambling and at times supremely boring, and leaves many loose ends dangling in the desert wind. Many of the decisions made by the characters in the book leave the reader baffled because Bowles gives a minimum of background information on them. While this may be called Bowles' &quot;style&quot; by some, it is more likely that the true culprit is amateurism. This is the kind of book that you finish in hopes of a fantastic ending with a few plot twists, but Bowles disappoints and leaves you feeling as empty as the desert landscape. He really misses the opportunity to bring back some of the characters he loses along the way.I am amazed that there are plans to make a major motion picture out of this book. The Sahara Desert will surely provide a boring visual complement to an already boring story. Though there are some cheap sex scenes in the story (which will likely be over-dramatized for public interest) the movie will, and should, flop."

This book explores these questions. In the introduction, the author is quite candid about the idea of a written journal being anachronistic, but does point out that Mary is described in Luke's Gospel as a ponderer, just the kind of person who might have kept a journal in a different time and place. Here the auther extrapolates what Mary's life might have been like, and her portrait is both sympathetic and believable. We find a wife and mother, who gets caught up in the minutia of day-to-day life, and sometimes has to remind herself what her son's role is meant to be. Unfortunately, this book ends with the beginning of Jesus's public ministry, so that we don't get to explore Mary's reactions to her son's public role, or witness the agony of standing at the base of the cross when he was crucified. There was a great deal of potentially powerful material that is left unexplored. While this story is enjoyable and moderately inspirational, it might have been truly great if it had pursued the story to its end."

B000I055J8,The March: A Novel,,A34KO7293BI235,Justin Mclaughlin,9/9,3.0,1174262400,What was Sherman Thinking?,"The March dramatizes Sherman's terrific coup de grace on the Confederacy. The novel weaves together many disparate characters, including a white-skinned slave, an Irish enlisted man, 2 rebel turncoats, a Union doctor, dispossessed plantation owners, a British journalist, a photographer and his prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, several Union Generals [including Sherman], and a few soldiers who meet their ends along the way.The book has some outstanding passages about the march itself, how it can be seen as a living organism unto itself, or even a roving civilization. Also, Doctorow has written fine, balanced dialogue; this seems to me an extremely difficult task, but somehow Doctorow has his characters sound exactly right -- not too antiquated or too modern. Add to this the author's obvious assimilation of the historical milieu and you've got the raw materials of a great novel. But, wait ... not quite.Perhaps the book's greatest shortcoming was intended to be its greatest strength: the vast array of characters. Although we can see why they are there [to present unique perspectives to better understand the great events], they are not given enough space to fully, deeply flourish. Another problem is that the narrator's omnipotence bleeds into the characters, making them at times seem less characters and more representations of historical forces. Thus the reason for writing a novel, instead of a history, is lost. It seems to me that fiction should allow us complete entry into another time and place, with all the prejudices and limitations of that experience. This novel never does that. Instead the reader feels ""taught"" the material, and is always aware of the distance between when the book is written and the events taking place within it. The reader never gets inside this world, never sustains a personal experiences the events of war. If a few of the principle characters were given more space, more depth, more nuance, perhaps this problem would be ameliorated.However, do not despair. If you are interested in the Civil War, or American history, then this book is definitely worth reading. EL knows his material well, and as a writer of prose is one of the best. Structurally, this reviewer simply feels different choices might have led to a truly superior novel, instead of a merely decent one."

B0000X8RB6,Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V,,AFJCOP0GKZH6C,M. B. Trapp,6/7,5.0,1142553600,"Strange, heartbreaking, and inspiring: a fine addition to The Dark Tower series","Over the past few years I've been reading through Stephen King's Dark Tower series. I've been doing this as part of an ongoing goal I have to read through many of the classic science fiction and fantasy books ever written. It all began with Tolkien and C. S. Lewis, but since then I've chewed through the likes of Ursula LeGuin, Arthur C. Clarke, Frank Herbert, and contemporary authors such as George R. R. Martin and Robert Jordan. The Dark Tower series has already become a legend in its own right as a strange amalgam of sci-fi, fantasy, and King's trademark, horror.What to say of Wolves of the Calla? Some complain that this volume doesn't live up to the previous four, but I couldn't disagree more. Wolves is as robust and wildly interesting an addition to the series as the previous four, and despite some off-the-wall criticisms, it most certainly does contribute to the overall Dark Tower story arc. What is that story arc? I will try to summarize this vast tale in a few sentences: In the world of the Tower there exist many, if not infinite, worlds. Indeed there are multiple versions of our own world, some where the difference is as minute as a difference in the name of a professional baseball team. These worlds are held together by a metaphysical lynchpin: the Dark Tower. Our hero is Roland the gunslinger of Gilead, a mythic warrior from one of these worlds who has discovered that there is something terribly wrong with the Tower. Its supports - ""Beams"" - are under attack and failing. Thus the very fabric of reality is weakening. Some worlds, like Roland's, have ""moved on."" They are running down: time itself doesn't behave correctly, and one day north becomes east and then corrects itself. As a part of this weakening of reality, doorways between these worlds are opened up through various means, allowing our heroes to pass back and forth.The quest of Roland is for the Dark Tower itself. The ancient caste of gunslingers, of which he is the last, has always had some veiled knowledge of the Tower, but as a young man Roland had a mystical experience of it. The quest to find and repair the tower has become an obsession for him. Due to the strange behavior of time, he has been seeking a way to get t the Tower, and the dark beings that now assail it, for over a thousand years. In Wolves we find Roland and his little band of up-and-coming gunslingers, exiles from our own world that he has ""drawn"" into his own, continuing on their quest. They are caught up in events in the rural town of Calla Bryn Sturgis, where creatures wearing wolf-masks ride into town on grey horses every generation or so and steal some of the town's children, only to return them as mental invalids who need constant care and die painfully and young. After hundreds of years the ""folken"" of Calla Bryn Sturgis have decided to stand up to the wolves and fight, even though their enemies carry weaponry far more advanced than their crossbows. As gunslingers Roland's band are morally required to help this town in need.Thus the tale of Wolves of the Calla unfolds. The whole plot follows the classic pattern of such films as Seven Samurai and The Thirteenth Warrior, where a small band of heroes is recruited to defend a helpless town from ruthless invaders. But of course with King, nothing is cliched, even when he's working with an established narrative formula. I've never read stories quite like the ones in the Dark Tower series, where everything is determined by what Roland calls ka, the rough equivalent of what we would call destiny. Thus while the protection of the Calla may seem like a side quest, all things serve ka, and in reality it is a crucial component of Roland's long journey to the Tower.The actual preparation and defense of the Calla is the most interesting part of the book. The revelation of what the wolves are, who they serve and why they take the children every twenty or thirty years is a mystery that King holds until the very end. In a long tale of over 3,000 pages an author has plenty of time for characterization, and King takes the opportunity to grow his characters in interesting and strange ways. Volume 4, Wizard and Glass, consists almost entirely of a flashback into Roland's youth that shows the reader how and why he has become the remarkable man that he has. We see his baptism of fire into the hard life of being a gunslinger, and we also see how personal tragedy has shaped his psyche. The same is true in Wolves to an extent, but this time the baptism of fire is not Roland's but Jake's, the twelve year old boy from the New York City of 1977. Like Roland, here Jake must make some difficult and tragic choices, and through those tragedies we see his dramatic metamorphosis from a confused boy into a hardened warrior.It is the idea of ka, more than anything else, that drives Roland and his companions on their quest. The gunslinger has a monumental sense of personal destiny. He was meant to find the Tower, and he is willing to sacrifice everything dear to him to find it. One reason I continue to read these books - despite the sheer darkness and obscenity that occasionally show up - is because Roland's quest is, in some sense, a quest for God. In the first book, The Gunslinger, the question comes up of who or what has the right or the ability to sit in the top level of the tower. The obvious answer is: only God. He is the one who is ultimately in control, and I assume that it is He who is behind ka. The idea of God's controlling sovereignty faded through some of the earlier volumes, but here it returns in force. Roland, although not a Christian, increasingly refers to the will of God in Wolves, and indeed it becomes almost interchangeable with the idea of ka. There is also some existential questioning in Wolves, as some of the characters begin to question if the top room of the Tower is actually empty. But I suspect that it is not.It is in this sense that I see the Dark Tower series as an inherently philosophical, even religious, tale. Roland's quest is not simply a journey to save the world. There is also the desire to find what really lies at the heart of existence. What is there, really? This is a metaphysical question. No, it is the metaphysical question. I also see in Roland's quest a desire to find his identity. Roland knows why he is here. Ka has determined that he should find the Tower, the lightning rod of all extant worlds. But yet there is also a sense in which he doesn't know why he is here. He doesn't know why he was chosen for this task, and in coming to that great field of roses in which the Tower stands, he hopes that he can find out. The answer that he ultimately seeks is to the question: who is God? I'm not sure if this is what King is thinking, or even if he would have the ability to articulate it in these terms, but I think that in finding the answer to that all important question, Roland is essentially in a search for the meaning of life. Wolves of the Calla is only one episode in his long search for the answer to that question, but it sure is a fun ride."

It's an absorbing tale of a woman's adjustment to the bleak and initially terrifying emptiness of the desert Southwest where her husband sets up an Indian trading post at the time of World War I. She comes to love the place and to appreciate the culture and manners of her Indian neighbors, which at first seem so alien to her. Hilda Faunce gives us a fascinating direct view of the interaction of Indians and whites, which is only the more interesting from our current vantage point 85 years later. I was struck by her simple, straightforward, but eloquent writing style as well as by her courage and receptiveness in facing a very challenging experience.

She has numerous possibilities to marry Selden--a kind, decent man (in contrast to repulsive ones like Rosedale) who adores her, but she cannot give up the riches of the upper crust in order to do so. Essentially--and this Lily admits to us at points during the book--she's in it for the cash, even if she does finally understand the opportunities she's wasted throughout (strange, for a woman who talks nonstop about &quot;opportunities...&quot;) And I think that, even if it's a correct reflection of the time in which she lived, Lily's motives ultimately destroys my sympathy for her as a character. I mean, a woman who complains because she can't have fresh flowers on the luncheon table every day? Come ON, Lily..."

There is a lot of philosophy packed into this short, fictitious account of several (three main characters) rich men who live life in a very nonchalant, yet formal environment. The characters are developed beautifully and invoke strong emotion toward each one. I found myself hating Henry, loving Basil and having strange mixed feelings for Dorian. While there are a lot of different views in regard to the overarching theme of the book, I believe (along with what seems like a majority) that the book is about morality. Man left to his own logic (shown in the character of Henry) is left only with death, and a meaningless existence. Dorian shows (I believe) the struggle of man in choosing a morality outside of human authority and logic. Dorian loses the struggle and of course it ends with his own death, which in reality is the logical conclusion to a life lived for one's own pleasure.It is interesting to note that Oscar Wilde was an accomplished painter himself, and got the idea for this book through an actual experience. I thoroughly enjoyed the story, and the different themes that the book brought out."

And yet, despite reading observations from numerous wise perspectives that Dante's insight, vision and creative genius were rivals to Shakespeare... getting myself up to sufficient speed on the historical, literary, and religious context of The Divine Comedy was too daunting.Professor Chiarenza's finely written little volume has proved just what I needed to help inspiration overcome inertia. Brief background chapters offer an interesting survey of 1) Historical context, 2) The Importance of the Work, and 3) Its critical reception. Then she devotes a chapter each to Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso. A pleasingly written explication of the complex dynamics of each afterlife realm offers refreshing clarity without overwhelming the newcomer. The author's ability to present the grandness of the poet's accomplishment conveys her love for the material without reducing herself to mere emotional gushing - offering the reader a sense of real reverence for this artist and his art that reminds me of Helen Vendler's ability simultaneously to inspect and respect creative greatness.The spiritual height to which Dante reached in order to wet his quill with inky grace comes strongly through in this sensitive survey.Although out of print at the moment, if found in a used copy, this volume will bless the reader who is open to develop or expand an appreciation of Dante.

Augie is not much different than the great protagonist Carrie Meeber ofSister Carrie. LikeSister Carrie, this is a tome. Well over 250,000 words, this book can be a great read, but it will require some significant time by the bed stand. Both Carrie and Augie fall upon success. Neither seeks it, it falls upon them. And, each is very humble upon the receipt. And, those around them are envious and admiring.The importance of education then, and even more true today, is outlined in one discourse. ""You should go out and find what you can do, and then after four years if you aren't any good at any special thing, you at least have this degree. And it won't be any sonofabitch who can kick you around."" Good advice. Then. And, today.But, going to school would not make a great storyline. So, we follow Augie who washes dogs, aids a pool hall owner, helps his brother in the in-law's business, trains eagles in Mexico, works with intellectuals in writing books, and eventually works on deals in France.. A war stint here, a time on the open sea there, and a few other diversions, not forgetting the women he wooed - as well as those who wooed him - make this an incredibly entertaining tale. And, we are truly glad that his wishes had not become true when he states, ""Sometimes I wished I could become a shoemaker too.""Great writing mixed with a great tale make this a great novel."

Many of the asanas are also appropriate for intermediate or advanced students. For me, attending a yoga class once a week and using this book as a supplement to home practice works well for me.Some people think of yoga as simply a physical discipline or another way to work out. Not so, because its emphasis is on not straining, not rushing and not competing. It is a system of helping the body become more flexible and promoting physical health, but it is also a way to know the self, transcend the ego and become enlightened, among other things.My primary focus right now is the physical training (hatha) aspect of it and gradual learning and practice of the spiritual aspects of it.

B00005NKLB,Rise to Rebellion: A Novel of the American Revolution,,AK7D1BHZOSOL1,General Pete,1/2,5.0,1038960000,"Different true, but still good","With this book Jeff Shaara follows the grand tradition that his father started with ""The Killer Angles"". Primarily the book follows Ben Franklin, John Adams, Sam Adams, General Gage and Gerorge Washintion.I love these kind of books because a good author (Shaara) can make the history seem as real as possible.My impression-I just love this book and its sequal ""This Glorious"" cause and if you liked ""The Killer Angles"" or ""The Last Full Measure"" you will like the book too"
B000NPMLBI,Big Red,,,,0/1,5.0,913593600,Very Good Book!,This book was very good. It had lots of excitement and good points of view. It was amazing how Red bayed the Bear Old Majesty. At first it was confusing and not too good and then going towards the middle it got excellent. The book is very descriptive and is just excellent! I could read it again if I had the time!

1575111004,Rime of the Ancient Mariner,,AYYVQB4IFT7P,Lac,2/3,5.0,1168732800,Cheap and well done,"Dover puts out quite the book. This edition being in the $5 range is no exception. It's the size of a large coloring book with the writing on the left and the pictures on the right. Printed well and bound to last a great number of years with plenty of space to write commentary of your own if you are a student.There is added text, printed very small, to the left of the actual poem. Some of it is interesting and some of it is superfluous. Very easy to ignore if you're not a 'footnote' reading person.The plates run to the full edge of the paper and there is no white border if you are the 'cut it our of the book and hand it on my wall type'. No bashing here this book is cheap enough to buy one to read and one to be artistic with."
1597370037,The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection),25.04,A2BNSWKIBNSBZN,Sandeep Bhadra,1/2,4.0,1045094400,Beauty and Beast portmanteau...,that would be the ideal way to describe Dorian Gray - an impressionable young Adonis on his Hedonistic quest for a life which itself is a work of art. Society artist Basil Hallward's portrait of Dorian Gray which ages and hardens as Gray's quest lead him to a remorseless and brutal lifestyle is the mirror to his soul while his physical form remains as youthful as ever. The book builds up beautifully towards the climax. Wilde's generates idle irreverent amoral and bitingly sarcastic dialogue as if out of thin air.
B000PGI7QI,Atlas Shrugged,,AWIKQVMA3WIM7,Nathan Rodriguez,9/10,5.0,1328054400,What is the Moral Compass to your Motor?,"I recently finished reading Ayn Rand's 1957 Epic: Atlas Shrugged. I had heard about it for years and at the urging of my sister to read it I finally started this monumental task. When I asked what it was about she really couldn't tell me, and after finishing it I now understand why. It is the story of a man who wished to stop the motor of the world. But what is the motor of the world, and more importantly, of each of us?""Who is John Galt?"" This phrase is the opening statement, and question of the book. It is initially a statement of despair, hopelessness and frustration in reply to questions for which there is no answer. Throughout the novel many stories are told as to the origin of the saying, and although each version is vastly different, they are all correct. As the story progresses the meaning and importance of the phrase evolves into a statement of defiance, triumph and pride. John Galt is an Idea, a legend, a destroyer and a savior. But which aspect is he to whom? The answer is all of them, and none of them.Rand was an Objectivist, and truth be told her ideals are a sort of a homage to the Romantic Capitalist, where one's mind is his greatest tool. The world in which Atlas Shrugged takes place seems to be in an alternate version of the 1950s, where the entire world with the exception of the United States has turned into a collection of Peoples States, and those in power, both in politics and business, are scheming and plotting to follow suit in the guise of the `Public Good' and `Welfare of the Common People.' While they preach morality and selflessness, their actions are in complete contradiction to what they profess to be their motives. These are the `Moochers,' `Looters' and `Cheaters' of the world. Amis the madness is a few individuals who hold themselves in high regard, and strive to achieve success completely on their own merit and skills. As such they become highly successful and become leaders in industry, however they are demonized as `Greedy,' `Selfish,' and `Uncaring' by the public, their peers and even their own families.Rand preaches of the virtue of selfishness, which upon first glance seems backward and cold, but check your premises, one of them is wrong. The Selfishness she exalts is not in the traditional sense that one may think of as often described by the religious and pious, but rather to be true to yourself and ensure your motives are clearly understood by yourself. There is nothing wrong with helping others and working for the betterment of mankind. But do not do it under false pretenses nor at the expense of delusional self-sacrifice. In an amazing speech given by one of the characters, they state that what most people claim as self-sacrifice is done out of selfish deceit to stave off their own misguided sense of guilt. ""'Sacrifice' is the surrender of that which you value in favor of that which you don't...If you own a bottle of milk and gave it to your starving child, it is not a sacrifice; if you give it to your neighbor's child and let your own die, it is.""It is a philosophical gold mine and I took something very important of great worth away from this read: Pride of my own abilities and a new sense of Self-Worth. As an entrepreneur I have started a venture from scratch, with nothing but a small startup fund earned from my day job and a few ideas in my head. While I had the amazing moral support of my wife, everything else was of my own desire. For a while I had reached a slump and I seemed to lose interest and could not find the motivation to continue on, and upon reading this novel I realized why, I had stopped creating for my own enjoyment, and began to create items that I thought would sell and what other people may enjoy. I had reduced myself to creating simplistic designs for easy reproduction and began to limit my own abilities, for the sake of others. I blame no one but myself, but as I read on I began to analyze my own motivations and began to uncover what was the true moral compass behind the motor of my being. Most importantly you must be happy with yourself, and you must live by your own moral guideline, not of what is expected of the outside world. Is the guilt you feel truly guilt? Or is it the illusion of guilt imposed by the outside world whose values they maintain mandate that you feel such things, even though you may not agree with the moral premise for their standard of existence?Most importantly, I discovered how much I valued my own mind, and what an amazing tool it is that we have been granted. No matter what is done or said, your mind is your own and it is the only thing that should not be stolen nor given away to those who cannot or will not use their own.Despite the length of the novel, it is a captivating read and you most certainly will identify and fall in love with characters. Personally I felt closest to Hank Reardon. If you have never read it, read it. Do not listen to what critics nor worshipers of this book say: get a copy and read it for yourself and form your own opinion on the philosophy and ideals presented in this epic. If you love it, spread the word and encourage everyone to dive into it themselves. If you hate it, suggest others to read it and see if they agree with you. Even if you do not agree with everything in the novel, you will take something from it, and hopefully discover something about yourself, how deep does the rabbit hole go?"
0821769995,Racing To Ruin (Zebra Historical Romance),,A5GYYHY2KI5CI,tregatt,3/3,4.0,990662400,spunky heroine and hero's witty banter makes this novel,"Unlike the other debutantes of the Season, Sabrina Bennett has no desire to find a husband; for Sabrina has her whole life mapped out for herself: she's going to spend her life in solitude, reading and writing articles for the newspapers: a husband and children would only mess up this rosy dream she has for her future. Unfortunately for Sabrina, her grandfather wants her married and off his hands. So Sabrina comes up with what she thinks of as a brilliant plan to engineer her own social ruin, and so ensuring that her dreams will come true. With her sister's (Amanda) help, she draws up a list of rakes with which to carry out her plan. What Sabrina doesn't know is that Amanda has hopes of forestalling this harebrained scheme. Amanda skillfully maneuvers Sabrina into the path of Hunter Lancaster, the Earl of Greystone, a man with the rather sordid reputaion of having fathered his own stepsister's child. Amanda knows that Hunter is not the scoundrel that society has painted him out to be, and feels that Sabrina will be safe with him.Hunter is furious when Sabrina propositions him to ruin her, and quite ruthlessly shots down her request. Little does Hunter expect that his path will cross Sabrina's again so soon after that! The next morning brings news of the horrific murder of a young debutante, Lady Jane. Sabrina is determined to discover who the murderer is, and invites herself to the house party of one of the suspects. Horrified at the turn of events, Amanda goes to Hunter for help. And so Hunter finds himself tracking down Sabrina, and assisting her (much against his will) in going through their &quot;host's&quot; personal effects. Imagine Hunter's surprise when Sabrina comes across a signet ring with a rather unique pattern that seems to suggest that Hunter's sister's seducer and the dead debutante's murder are somehow tied together. But how? However even before either Sabrina or Hunter can proceed with their investigations, all hell breaks loose. Somehow word of their outing has been leaked and Hunter is forced to offer for Sabrina, even as she is forced to accept his proposal of marriage. Can these two who seemingly have so little in common and who seem to grate on each other's nerves make this hasty marriage work? And will Hunter and Sabrina discover who murdered Lady Jane?I rather enjoyed &quot;Racing to Ruin.&quot; It was a really fun read. Sabrina Bennett is so spunky, smart and vivacious, that she completely disarmed me even as I groaned over her rather teenage tendency to carry out a scheme without thinking it through! It is this pluck and resolution that makes her the perfect match for Hunter Lancaster in spite of the very obvious age difference between them. I also liked that Stacey Brown devoted quite a few chapters to showing these two trying to make their marriage work, and coming to terms with their different expectations. Something else that made this novel really enjoyable for me was Hunter and Sabrina's witty repartee. It's been quite a while since I read such banter.All in all, &quot;Racing to Ruin&quot; is a really fun read, and well worth recommending."

It was fun to read about how the americans lost against the British the first time.Then they won against the british the second time.

B0006D7VAI,Lord Edgware Dies: formerly Thirteen At Dinner (Greenway Edition),,A59TM6OC16NXM,FeathersMcGraw,2/3,4.0,1106006400,"""Please help me get rid of my husband!""","This classic Poirot novel(alternative title- ""13 at Dinner"")is a good, quick read when you're in the mood for a mystery.What I particularly liked about the story, is that it takes you for a spin. At first it all seemed so obvious I got a little annoyed. And although it is all so obviously simple in the end, Christie does a wonderful job at making the reader, as well as her detective hero, believe otherwise. I also liked this one because it is narrated by Poirot's trusty sidekick, Captain Hastings(Christie's version of Dr. Watson)who ordinary man that he is, proves invaluable to Poirot, and ultimately is the one person who can help him.I Strongly recommend to any Christie fan, or anyone who just likes a good mystery now and then."
B00071OHXI,Casebook of a psychic detective,,A1N2L9A6I686G5,"Katie ""book worm""",7/7,5.0,1121385600,A Book Worth Searching For!!!,"It's a shame that this book is no longer in print, as it's an awesome look into the way psychics use their gift to help law enforcement catch the ""bad guys""! It also allows one to see just how hard it was (and probably still is) for psychics to be taken seriously, as well as the lack of recognition given to them by the very people they've helped.In ""Casebook of a Psychic Detective"", the author describes how she became involved in psychic police work to begin with, and then goes into great detail describing the cases she's worked on, and the ways in which she's received pertinent information for each one.This book is definitely a page turner - in fact, I haven't been able to put it down since I started! If you are at all interested in psychic phenomena, then I highly recommend this book for you!"

B000K6LSWS,The Great Game : The Struggle for Empire in Central Asia,,A7CEP1AKDJXFO,"Old Guy ""Northern chef""",0/0,5.0,1356652800,"A fascinating, fast read.","I am a student of the imperial world. I am also a surveyor and have visited Pakistan's northwest tribal area. I received this book as a gift. It is simply wonderful; I didn't want to put it down. The book provides excellent insight into the thinking of the times through it generous use of quotes from official reports, fantastic pictures and excellent maps.There was one point though that I needed clarified. In the book he refers to the Pashtun people by their Urdu name Pathan. (According to Wikipedia, ""Throughout the Indian subcontinent, excluding Pashtun-dominated regions, they are often referred to as Pathans."")The book is the grand story of the tale told in Rudyard Kipling's ""Kim."""
B000N76ZCC,Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban,,,,2/2,5.0,1136332800,As If I Was There,"This book is an amazing adventure of Harry during his third year at Hogwarts. But while Harry is enjoying this new year a prisoner (Sirus Black) escapes from the dreaded prison of Azkaban and sends world wide panic in both the magic and muggle world. Harry encounters new spells, friends, foes and creatures in the third book of the Harry Potter series.This sequel to The Chamber of Secrets is a fascinating book. Though it is slow in the beginning, the adventure at Hogwarts will blow you away. When the story turned sad, exciting or surprising, I felt that emotion as if I was there. This book reveals its own mysteries and has a breath-taking end. This is a great book for ages ten and up. It is a good sequel to its past books and a great introducer to many more."

Clerkin ""ssbn 654""",1/2,5.0,1190764800,Philbrick is a master of this genre,"I stumbled on Nathaniel Philbrick's book: ""In The Heart of The Sea"" and enjoyed it very much. This author has the rare ability to take historical records, diaries, narratives, and other documents and weave them into a prose style of his own that is gripping. ""Sea of Glory_____""is written for anyone who likes history, nautical based, and replete with characters that you come to feel you know after the reading. The troubled Commander of the US Ex. Ex., comes alive in the pages with deep insight into his psyche & human flaws. I would recommend this book to any reader. It truly is the ""untold"" story of the United States of America's attempts to send forth a seagoing expedition of exploration on the level of the more famed Lewis & Clark land expedition after the Louisiana Purchase. You will be amazed at the ongoing contributions this expedition has contributed to our knowledge of the natural world, including the origins of what is today The Smithsonian Institution."
B000PW9W66,Roots : The Saga of an American Family,,,,3/3,5.0,992476800,"Entertaining, Humerous, and Moving","This book was the best I have ever read, and I have read dozens and dozens of them. Some were good, but none brought on the same feelings as this particular novel. Alex Haley has told true, hard-core facts, but also adds a twist of his own story with humor and a style all his own. It begins in Kunta Kinte's small African village and the description of the very strict ways of his Mandinka tribe. It then progresses very quickly into the often horrifying story of the treatment of slaves when he is kidnapped and shipped to America. He has happy times there, but the bad ones far outnumber them. It is an amazing story of both personal and family strength, and I would reccomend it to anyone."

What guts to go undercover with child pornographers for 16 yrs. Every detail is important to Race, every move he makes and every person he comes in contact with, could make him or break him. I infact became quite attached to Margaret and Enmi, I don't know how Race carried on playing the game of chance. To tell you the truth, I found what he put his family though for 16 years really quite stupid...in this case his work came before his wife and the growing up of his child...a part from this, I couldn't put the book down and I wanted to know more about the reaction of Jacques.. Well done..excellent read."
B000GROPF8,"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)",,,,0/0,5.0,940982400,One of the best books this century,"In Animal Farm, Orwell illustrates that the &quot;classless&quot; &quot;utopian&quot; society that marxist communism attempts to setup is unacheivable. It demonstrates human natures want and need of power. Using pigs as the leaders of the communist government that was setup was a nice touch of symbolism. I highly recommend this book."
0345395093,"Planetfall (Genellan, Bk. 1)",,,,4/6,3.0,946857600,Just Okay,"This is an action packed book with lots of alien creatures, both intelligent and not. I was mostly disappointed with the non-intelligent creatures of Genellan. Except for the dragon/lizzard thing, all the others were based on creatures from earth. It would have been better with a diverse and more bizarre collection of plants and animals. I just found it hard to believe that so many creatures would mirror what we have on earth. The big, bad guys from the 2nd planet are pretty well thought out, as are the cliff dwellers of Genellan. The book had way too many characters in it. The author used a last name here and a first name there and that made it very difficult to keep a vision of anyone but three or four people alive in my head as the book went on. Some of the adventures or incidents in the book where a little on the corny side but at least it wasn't boring. The ending was too predictable. I knew roughly how it would end before I was half way through the book. All in all it was entertaining, yet I would have traded some of the dangerous action sections for some well conceived, descriptive narrative of the odd life forms one would expect to encounter on an alien planet."
B000J4M79E,"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind",,A3VRL229ETS9TE,"""gourlie""",7/8,5.0,1088899200,Soto Zen explained with perfect simplicity,"There are two major brands of Zen, the Soto (a.k.a. &quot;gradual&quot;) and Rinzai (a.k.a. &quot;sudden&quot;) schools. Shunryu Suzuki outlines with crisp clarity the fundamental beliefs and practices that underlie Soto Zen. &quot;Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind&quot; is a collected edition of his talks which strike closest to the heart of the Soto school of the modern day. I found this book relevatory as a beginning practitioner of Zen.For beginners, I also recommend &quot;Zen in the American Grain,&quot; by Kyogen Carlson. It's especially useful for those trying to reconcile Western culture with Zen practice.As a previous reviewer has noted, &quot;Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind&quot; is not intended as an introduction to &quot;Buddhism&quot; -- it seems to me that there are in fact far too many Buddhisms for such a book to be written."

Years later I was in England, and I discovered that there was a whole book of stories. Over the years I have re-read this book so much that it is now in tatters. Each story is a gem unto itself. Each story will become another jewel in your treasure chest of lenses, which help you to see the world more clearly. Now that I have discovered that this book is still in print, I expect to buy multiple copies to give as Christmas Gifts this year. Do yourself a favor and don't miss these delightful additions to your life. (Psst : I like this book !)"

I find it impossible to read four pages without laughing aloud. The only 18th Century novel close to it for sheer delight is Fielding's &quot;Tom Jones.&quot;"
B000GYWPTE,Of Mice and Men,,,,0/1,5.0,927072000,Fabulous,"The story, Of Mice and Men, is a story about two men named Lennie Small and George Milton that travel from town to town looking for somewhere to work. Lennie doesn't have it all upstairs and likes to pet small, furry animals. He relies on George to take care of him, and he has a dream of owning a Rabbit Farm and tending the rabbits. George always yells at Lennie for the stupid stuff he does, but everything comes out for the good. One day on the ranch they were working at, Lennie went to see the puppies in the barn and met Curley's wife their. Curley is a small and stout sort of guy that hates big guys. Lennie crushed his hand in a fight they had earlier. Lennie started feeling Curley's wife's hair and felt how soft it was. When she told him to let go, Lennie panicked and held on. He ended up snapping her neck and killing her. He didn't mean anything that he did, but it happened. Later on, George pulls a gun on Lennie and shoots him in the head. A very bizarre ending to such a great book. Lots of events fall behind all that so read it to find out."

I absolutely loved the first book...haven't gotten the other five in the series but I'm sure Ill get there because if they are anything like the first I will certainly enjoy them all.

If you haven't tried her yet, this is a wonderful one to start with. Nobody gets into the lives and minds of their characters quite like Anne Tyler. She understands them, their motivations, their feelings, their joys and regrets.This is a novel about families and how the lives of sometimes mis-matched people end up intimately connected by a quirk of nature or marriage. Rebecca Davitch married for love and then lost her husband far too early, inheriting a typically dysfunctional family, including an elderly live-in uncle, and a business organising and hosting parties. Just turned 50 and at a family picnic Rebecca begins to look inward and back, asking that tricky question often avoided - &quot;what if? - exploring the corners unturned, the roads untravelled, that have placed her in this moment in this unexpected life she is living. Like all families, the Davitches are ripe with tensions and misunderstandings, but also with love and affection, and inspite of everything that has happened, inspite of the &quot;might have beens&quot;, Rebecca is and remains the heart and soul of the family.Anne Tyler writes with real warmth and insight and brings all the characters to life. She writes like a dream and draws you into the world she has created. Not to be missed."

B0007J292Q,Strange empire (Swan),,A2EDP6FT5PJGQL,Barney Considine,9/9,4.0,1165276800,Strange Empire,"In large measure, this book is the history of Louis Riel, a Metis leader, and his efforts to gain recognition and independence for the Metis people. Since the ethnic group usually called Metis was closely tied to Riel, the book is also a partial history of that group.Metis is a French word that can be translated as ""mixed blood."" In a narrow sense, one might think of the Metis as the offspring from intermarriage between the French and Indians (mostly Cree) of eastern Canada during the early days of the fur trade. In a practical sense, the group must be broadened to include at least Chippewa, English, and Scot parentage. In the context of the twentieth century, an even broader definition is used. However, some combination of white and Indian linage is usually a prerequisite.This book is a classic by a legendary author of Montana history. Joseph Kinsey Howard (1906-1951) is also known for another classic, ""Montana: High, Wide, and Handsome,"" a book considered for decades as the definitive history of Montana. Howard spent much of his short life in an area of Montana that has a significant Metis population. He understood the Metis, respected them, and spent years preparing to write ""Strange Empire.""The original publication was in 1952. More recent issues include an introduction by Nicholas C. P. Vrooman, Director of the Institute for Metis Studies at the College of Great Falls, Montana. This introduction is a magnificent addition.The Metis were primarily a product of the fur trade. Their language was a hybrid of French and Indian; definitely not English. Most of the Metis communities remained in close contact with the local Indian tribes. Many of these mixed blood people were drawn to the Red River which flows north from the present states of Minnesota and North Dakota into Canada and on to Hudson Bay.Louis Riel had trained for priesthood, but hadn't become a priest. Despite occasional self-doubt, Riel had many characteristics of leadership. He was literate and a good speaker and, more importantly, was fluent in English. The Metis attempted to establish their own nation in the Red River Valley. Howard beautifully summarizes the Metis situation: ""This conflict between the Metis and the Canadian government was not only a battle over native and Euro-American claims, but also an age-old fight between Catholicism and Protestantism, English and French, English and Irish, and English and American causes."" Louis Riel and the Red River Metis faced the Canadian forces with little loss of life on either side. Some people feel that the decision of whether the United States or Canada would rule what is now central and western Canada hung in the balance. The Metis won many of their goals but came under Canadian rule. One result is that the Red River part of Canada became the province of Manitoba in 1870. However, for his part in the ""rebellion,"" Canada exiled Riel for five years and he went to the United States.The Metis were buffalo hunters but were significantly different from Indians. They dressed differently. Many combined their hunting with agriculture. They had their own language. They had their own culture, a melding of the cultures from which they came. They were much more efficient at commercial buffalo hunting than were the Indians. Their background in the fur trade meant that they had the weapons, hunting experience, and trading expertise needed. Synonymous with the Metis is the Red River cart. Pulled by draft animals, it had high wheels and could carry several hundred pounds. With these carts, the Metis could transport the hides, pemmican, and dried meat of many buffalo to market locations. Twice yearly, the Metis gathered in a large force to go to the buffalo herds.As the buffalo herds dwindled, the Metis went further west for their hunts. As a result, Metis communities developed in the Turtle Mountain area of North Dakota, the Milk River country of Montana, and Saskatchewan in Canada. Later, communities developed near Lewistown and Great Falls, Montana, (note that most of these locations were undeveloped, and probably unnamed, when the Metis first arrived). Louis Riel moved westward also and became a teacher at a mission in the area of Great Falls.In Saskatchewan, the Metis were experiencing problems dealing with the Canadian government; problems very similar to what they had experienced in the Red River country. In 1884, the Canadian Metis appealed to Riel to serve as their leader and negotiator. Riel answered the call. Ultimately, an armed conflict evolved with the Canadian military and Mounties facing the Metis and their Indian allies. This time the Metis were crushed. Louis Riel was tried and hung.There is disagreement concerning Riel's role in Saskatchewan. Some people feel he became insane, some dispute that opinion. He felt that God guided him and when a disagreement arose with the Catholic priests, he attempted to separate the Metis from the Catholic Church. The Metis uprising in Saskatchewan was probably doomed from the beginning, but Riel made things worse by his indecision between peaceful negotiations and the use of force.In 1982, an amendment to the Canadian constitution gave the Metis aboriginal rights. In the United States, the Metis do not have a legal relationship with the government and do not have a reservation or enjoy other rights granted to Native Americans. In each recent session of the U.S. Congress, there have been bills concerning what is often termed Montana's Landless Indians. Many of this group are Metis.This book reads almost like a novel. It is well researched. Every book published since ""Strange Empire"" and containing a mention of the Metis, references Howard's book. A comprehensive and modern history of the Metis is needed but at the moment, this reviewer is unaware of anything near as useful as ""Strange Empire."""

Deep in Rio's favellas, Tony learns that sometimes going along is the only way to stay alive. Still, life is mostly good--he has fallen in love with a beautiful woman, had a paying job, and Rio is in full carnival mode, with some of the world's most beautiful women on full display.Then the entire thing falls apart. His boss seems to lose faith in him, the gangsters are putting pressure on him to support them in a major heist, and his girlfriend seems to have a powerful boyfriend who wants to see Tony out of the way no matter what it takes. Tony, along with his friend and sidekick Rock Bottom, will have to move fast to stay ahead of the wave of disaster bearing down on them.Author J. R. Ripley does a convincing job portraying Rio de Janeiro in high carnival season. The samba beat, the contrasts of extreme wealth and abject poverty, and the curious position of law enforcement (being sometimes more dangerous than the people they are supposed to protect against) all ring true. The mystery itself is less convincing. When Brazil's Federal Police finally ask Tony and Rock for their assistance, one can only wonder why--it certainly isn't explained, nor does it make a great deal of sense. As a mystery reader, I also expect to learn all the clues that the point of view protagonist learns. In THE BODY FROM IPANEMA, a key clue was withheld from the reader but not from Tony, making the mystery perhaps more interesting from the reader's perspective, but fundamentally cheating on the implicit contract between author and reader."

Main message obsured by diatribe,"The `Message' in a message to Garcia is about self reliance, skill and dedication to task. Not as some would interpret slavish obedience to higher authority. It is about taking a goal and objective and achieving it despite lack of information. That's all. It's the difference between being told how to do something, and when that fails giving up - and being told what we want to achieve and achieving it despite setbacks.The details of what Rowan knew or did are not articulated in this pamphlet. Who knows whether he, understood the gravity of the mission, bought into the legal, moral and ethical dilemma's of the politics - This makes him seem slavish.The language in the pamphlet is archaic and prejudiced against what the author undoubtedly sees as the shiftless worthless masses and this also now dilutes the message - which I believe is this.Which is the person more sort after- the person who simply can be given a task to accomplish and will go ahead and accomplish it - or the person who needs guiding and managing through every step and nuance of implementation?As far as Hubbard's distain for the ""man who asks Why"", I think that this is artifact of the prejudice and ignorance of the time, - when the prevalent attitude was that people shouldn't question their betters."
B0009QRZQ2,The Stranger,,A2U9C3XH4DFHZ2,anner442,1/1,5.0,1235692800,The Stranger and Alienation,"Camus's The Stranger has often been used as a theme of alienation from society. I often want to teach it as the opposite. The themes and ideas are to show the ""normal"" human person who finds themselves in deeply emotional events...but they do not show the appropriate emotions at the appropriate period of time. Is this normal? We have seen people overreact and act overly emotionally to deaths or other situations for base reasons. Does that make them normal? We often know people are faking their reactions at funerals and playing a role. This is normal. The precips of The Stranger tell us that acting a role does not make the emotion real. The protagonist does not bother to act the role that society assigns him and he is JUDGED! This is the crux of this novel. I love this novel because it makes me examine humans as individual creatures...we cannot be encapsulated by one defining theme or idea. Humans are much too confusing and evolving to capture in one defining moment forever. They will be, as in Camus's novel, judged, but it reflects life...and life changes. We all do."

B000OVNMNM,Foundation and Empire,,A1AUBGENRIZODO,Dave Deubler,1/1,5.0,1072051200,The Golden Age Classic Continues,"Asimov's Golden Age classic Foundation Trilogy is one of the early milestones of the science fiction genre. This second installment is less episodic than the first volume, focusing on just two specific stories. The first volume, &quot;Foundation&quot;, sets up the whole idea of the Seldon Plan, a mathematically based view of sociopolitical forces that enables one brilliant scientist to grow a new galactic empire from a foundation of one hundred thousand scientists and their families. &quot;Empire&quot; starts off in the same vein, showing how the Foundation staves off annihilation at the hands of the currently decaying, but still dangerous Galactic Empire. Once again, the magic of this section is the subtle means by which the Foundation overcomes impossible odds, and the convincing arguments Asimov uses to make the solution seem inevitable. Part Two involves an internal struggle between the Foundation's authoritarian central government and the Independent Traders who spread that government's economic power. While the Foundation is threatened with civil war, the rise of a new warlord on Kalgan poses a danger to the entire human race.Because each story is substantially longer than those in Foundation, this volume focuses more on individual characters. In fact, it is not too much to say that a major theme is the historical question, ""Do individuals matter?"" As a result, the characters are developed slightly more, and there's even a wistful love triangle, and considerably more action than was featured in the first volume, which tended to be distant and impersonal. If you liked Foundation, you'll surely enjoy this and the climax to the series, Second Foundation.Although these books will strike many as hopelessly dated, Asimov's sweeping historical vision should not be missed by any fans of speculative fiction. They have a directness and honest charm about them that is rare in contemporary science fiction. Later additions to this series, both sequels and prequels, don't adhere to the tone of these original novels, and really add very little except bulk."

You can click to the next page if you want to read the rest of the review.Here I'll add that it's an important book for another reason: between the lines, it makes a tremendous concession to non-Objectivist ethics.In the opening essay, on p. 24 of the current paperback edition, Rand acknowledges that there is such a thing as &quot;socially objective value&quot; -- her term for what Mises would have called _subjective_ value -- and says it is this kind of value that the free market serves.In the course of discussing this sort of value, Rand concedes (with her teeth gritted) that the values appropriate for what she called &quot;man _qua_ man_&quot; (and here defines as &quot;man at his best&quot;) just aren't appropriate for everybody.If this insight were followed up consistently, the whole Objectivist ethic would need to be revised from the ground up.

The deceased's angry adult children, though they inherit a fortune, will protest the will. Because of their attitude and the belief by her father and other uncle that she is incapable of doing the job, Nicole reluctantly agrees to take charge.Nicole moves to Houston where she meets doubt from the work force, opposition from the board, and animosity from her male cousin. She also finds herself attracted to Marcus who reciprocates the feeling as he finds her intelligent.

When her mother abruptly and unexpectedly leaves, Enola is under the guardianship of her brothers, who say she must be sent to boarding school. But Enola is enough of a young intellect to know that boarding schools for girls are institutions of repressions: of thought and of behavior. So she runs away from her now-empty home, on her bicycle, heading toward London to look for her mother. Along the way she encounters a mystery which, in clever fashion, she solves . . . while eluding her older brothers, who are looking for her.Enola is a sympathetic character, well-depicted. She behaves much as I imagine a 14-year-old at that time would behave, assuming she had the Holmes genes in her blood. Springer's writing is wonderful to read: it seems effortless, which requires much work on the part of the writer. The vocabulary she uses helps characterize her hero. The words and phrases and sentence structure seem very Victorian, so reading this series is a good way for young people to learn about things such as dress styles for men and women, transportation, lighting, means of communication, housing, and the like, all in the late 19th century.

B0008CRBJS,An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics),,A3MAN5CBRX1KEV,Maxim Masiutin,0/0,4.0,1228608000,Invisible Hand,"This book is so widely cited and interpreted contrary to the author's original thought, that every economist should read it completely to avoid being misled by such incorrect interpretations.First, let us take the ""invisible hand"" metaphor. When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the ""invisible hand"" which means ""self-corrective markets"", ""liberalism"", ""Laissez-faire"" and ""state non-intervention"". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term ""invisible hand"" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term ""invisible hand"" is used: ""First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.""After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about ""invisible hand"" or ""Laissez-faire"". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day. Just don't start reading economic books from this book. It would be hard to understand. It assumes that you already have economics background, i.e. have studied economics for a few years.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist. You can get an audio version of this book to avoid lengthy read."

There are lots of articles from &quot;big names&quot; in Catholic Biblical scholarship. So, one will get the most up-to-date thinking on authorship, dates, readings, etc. and so forth. The translation is the same reliable NAB for the Old and New Testaments. The translation of the Hebrew Scriptures can be a little too dynamic, rendering perfectly understandable Hebrew idioms into English. But, the literal Hebrew is usually referenced in the notes. The same could be said for the New Testament. For all its girth, it is not a pretty Bible, though, and the pages are thin. My great disappointment is the bowdlerized version of the Psalms which have been &quot;inclusivized&quot; to the point of mistranslation. It's one thing to translate the generic word for &quot;man&quot; as &quot;human being&quot; or whatever (no, I have no problem with that); quite another to change third-person address into second-person (i.e., &quot;He is the LORD&quot; becomes &quot;You are the LORD.&quot;) This is not always done consistently, however, which makes the slipshod translation look even more inconsistent and slipshod. The Book of Psalms is where the NAB's translating committee's agenda trumped its duty to translate . . . and, it is a pity."

I heard about it in USA Today a month ago; they had named one of their top-10 beach reads so I thought I'd give it a try. What a rocket!! The opening pages are very creepy, very mysterious. You read it and you want to know: What are these creatures? Where are they from? What are they doing? It just sucked me right in!!From there the book takes off! An aside: I was surprised to enjoy the characters as much as I did. Some are quite funny, very likeable; they actually felt like real people with real human issues, not the typical cardboard cut-out stuff. I also read chick-lit but thought the characters here were very strong. Especially Lisa Barton. And Monique? You go girl!! The other aspects - the creatures' physical descriptions, the spooky imagery, the settings - are all very well done; and the places this book takes you - to the depths of the ocean - so awe inspiring! - to a spooky, fog-enshrouded redwood forest - genuinely fascinating; surprisingly, this was a great little travelogue just at a breakneck pace!!But the science here is what makes this book truly special. Natural Selection's depth and breadth of science is EXTRAORDINARY. The author clearly did a lot of research!! I work in a related field - otalaryngology/ENT - and let me tell you, he knows his stuff: the commentary on the evolution of the brain, evolution of the lung, the fluid dynamics discourse and many, many other facets were just so well done. He got a few details on some of the brain stuff wrong but it didn't really matter. I could not read the pages fast enough!! And the ending!! The ending is so scary, so unexpected, so great --- I'm talking Sixth Sense great!! People will be talking about this ending!!I liked this book so much I actually started re-reading it immediately just to see what I had missed. Then my 13 year old ripped it out of my hands. (He is a voracious reader himself and already 50 pages in.) Natural Selection is just FANTASTICALLY ENTERTAINING: You will be hooked, believe me!!!"
B000MS5P3M,The Sand Pebbles,,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,Roger J. Buffington,31/33,5.0,1086739200,America present at China's emergence as a nation.,"&quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; is an interesting and entertaining novel set in China circa 1925. China is governed by feuding warlords, and its foreign trade is dominated by foreign &quot;treaty powers&quot; including the USA, Japan, and the leading European nations, all of which maintain strong naval and marine forces in China to maintain their positions and protect foreign persons and property.The novel takes place on an obsolete, barely functioning American river gunboat, the &quot;San Pablo,&quot; known to her crew as the &quot;Sand Pebble.&quot; The protagonist, Jake Holman, is an engineer-crewman aboard the Sand Pebble. Jake has a passion for mastering the ship's engines, but initially is frustrated by the fact that aboard the Sand Pebble each American sailor has a Chinese coolie understudy who in fact does almost all of the work aboard ship. The Sand Pebble crewmen have delegated almost all of the ship's routine to a shadow crew of Chinese coolies, and do very little actual work. Jake's frustration with the coolie-understudy system and his attempt to fit in with the Sand Pebble crew are part of the main theme of the novel.The real story of &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; is, however, the emergence of China as a modern nation. The Kuomantang Chinese Nationalist movement is becoming ascendant in China as the novel unfolds, and it seeks to sweep away foreign influence, and the warlord system that has kept China weak and divided. The officers and crew of the &quot;Sand Pebble,&quot; in common with the other foreign military forces, must deal with this new movement, which seeks to change Old China, which had seemed eternally unchangeable. The slow understanding by the foreigners, including the Sand Pebble, that this change is real and something that must be dealt with, is the real story in the novel.Author McKenna does a masterful job of presenting China as it was in the 1920s, together with life in the American gunboat navy of those times. This is a novel rich with detail and atmosphere. Both the American and Chinese protagonists are presented with dignity and insight, making this a very interesting read. While the storyline of crewman Holman is interesting enough, this is only an excuse to tell the real story--the transformation of China.This novel will reward the patient reader. I personally found it engrossing and entertaining. Recommended."

I first read it in the 1960s when it was published and decided to read again as we near the century mark of the Great War. I read it as a companion to Tuchman's Proud Tower which is a study of European society in the last years of the 19th century and the early years of the 20th; her quest was to try to discover what it was about that time that lead Europe, in the height of its power and creativity, to lose its mind.

B000GRQ7AE,August 1914,,A1BA72K4VK1UN1,"Patrick W. Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster""",4/4,5.0,1288656000,"Uneven and unpolished, but still superb (details)","There are two primary facets of this novel, for a novel it is in terms of many of the fictional characters:1. The author artfully places his finger directly on the pulse of Russian culture and society during one of this nation's most turbulent periods, an era of infinitely morphing politics and attitudes. The absolute Monarchy of the Romanovs was crumbling as acts and thoughts of revolution spread pervasively through the chatter of young ideologues. Solzhenitsyn probes the internal activities of a few Russian families (one of which is clearly autobiographical) where characters holding various political views manifest and begin to develop.2. Chiefly, the book is all about the first two weeks of World War One from the Russian perspective. A protagonist of sorts eventually emerges from this diaphanous yarn, Georgii Vorotyntsev, an intelligent and pragmatic Russian colonel who is highlighted by his shrewd judgment and his justifiable pessimism.Of course in retrospect, we know that the Russian invasion of East Prussia [Germany] commenced like a ball of fire and then swiftly reversed itself into total disaster, mostly due to centralized military ineptness and wishful thinking by The Tsar and his dull-witted appointees. The inability of the Russian army to adapt strategy and tactics to the ever changing battlefield resulted in their early demise and continued to plague them throughout the war. In the story, Colonel Vorotyntsev attempts to effect early corrections but blind stupidity at the very top effectively bulldozes his most valiant efforts.World War One was one of the stupidest wars ever fought -- it was initiated at the behest of out-of-control egos of the competing monarchs and as inconvenient treaties and alliances between these respective countries expanded the conflict into a global event. All concerned fully expected this war to be a brief one but of course, this was not to be and consequently millions were slaughtered, soldiers, sailors, and civilians alike.The author wisely remained un-diverted by the complex causes of the war, steadfastly focusing upon his literary agenda to particularly describe events. He took on specific developments of the war's early period and ultimately yielded up the amazing minutiae of these events, fictional to some degree but still fairly accurate, much in parallel with how Tolstoy'sWar and Peace (Modern Library Classics)fictionally but precisely detailed Napoleon's invasion of Austria and subsequently of Russia.From the beginning, Solzhenitsyn notes that he'll likely not finish this story in his lifetime but he clearly wanted to get a lengthy prologue of sorts into print, at least in part. Some of his characters are left hanging and we wonder what becomes of them. He even retracts a particular chapter [Chapter 22] for reasons which the reader remains uninformed. Solzhenitsyn's attitude comes through as, 'Something is better than nothing at all'. I wholly agree in this instance, especially since what he did yield up over these 622 pages is notably compelling.It's not unusual to encounter unfinished works by noted Russian authors -- we see it with Pushkin but probably the most widely-known example is that of Gogol's masterpiece,Dead Souls: A Novel; however, I consider that we are blessed that all these significant, if incomplete tales, made it into print. Of course we additionally thankfully later get the author'sNovember 1916: The Red Wheel / Knot II.For all its warts [chiefly in the form of omissions], *August 1914* makes us drool a bit for more, thus the five stars which I have awarded this superb work. Michael Glenny's translation is articulate and flowing so that the reader might garner the entire scope of Solzhenitsyn's insightful writing. The maps located on the inside covers are indispensable -- in their absence most readers would be lost.For any enthusiast of either Russian novels or for rabid war historians, I most emphatically recommend this superb fictional [and yet true] book.[NOTE: If you are especially interested in further exploring classic Russian literature, I have posted a couple of Amazon *Listmania Lists* on this specific topic -- just go to my profile and click on *Listmania Lists*]"

But in 'The Martian Chronicles', a somewhat loose collection of short stories involving humans (from Earth) colonizing Mars, this reader was left wanting for something insightful or special. Instead I found this collection of stories to be very readable, at times interesting, but also at times rather bland. And at no time did I sense this book deserved to be considered a classic. This would be an insult to its author who has indeed written classics (eg, 'Fahrenheit 451').Bottom line: a somewhat forgettable book that seems to have garnered more readership than it deserves. A near miss."

B0006CBNKI,To kill a mockingbird,,,,1/2,5.0,1086652800,To Kill a Mockingbird,"To Kill a Mockingbird is definitely one of my all time favorite books. It teaches everyone a great lesson about being prejudice to other people of a different race. It shows that even kids like Scout and Jem are aware of these issues and can be bigger people about the issue than some adults. They also face other hardships in their life other than prejudice. Scout is always being pressured into being lady like and not to play with the boys and what they do. That is not what Scout is like though, she likes she be with her brother and his friend and do what he wants do to. She doesn't like to be with other girls have tea parties. She is one very unique girl. I can relate to her in this way, because nobody wants to be girly all the time. Sometimes you have to be different from other people. Nobody wants to sit up straight all the time and be nice and pretty. Being different isn't bad all the time. Both Jem and Scout have to deal with having no mother and living with only their father and their caretaker. They are very different characters but that is what makes them so interesting. This book has a clear lesson, that we should treat every person with the same amount of respect. We shouldn't treat people of a different race differently. They are the same on the inside as everybody else. I think if you're looking for a good book to read this would be the one to choose."

De Ferraz ""ferraz9""",33/44,5.0,1073001600,"This can be your Vini, vidi, vinci in Latin.","Latin is known to all as a difficult language to learn, and difficult it is, specially due to its synthetic language character, contrary to the character analytic of the modern English language, which, coming from the Germanic family of languages, in its evolution stripped itself from many synthetic features, what adds difficulty to every student of Latin who speaks English as its mother tongue. Due also to the common Indo-european heritage both languages have, we could call Latin an Uncle of English, as if in a type of patrilineal relationship that happened in some primitive peoples. And this uncle-ish character is fully preserved in the exercise book &quot;38 Latin Stories&quot;, by Anne Groton and James May, and this is a pretty much good surprising characteristic of it.The book is designed for English speaking students who are using the famous and good &quot;Wheelok's Latin&quot; as its Latin Grammar. I bought the two books together but jumped rigth away to &quot;38 Latin Stories&quot; and was not disappointed at all. I got in fact a lot of fun out of it and all the pleasure and satisfaction I was expecting, which means the authors did a good job. Each of the 38 stories presented are famous texts of Latin or Greek ancient authors adapted to a modern reader, and the lessons are increasing in difficulty, according to the corresponding chapters of Wheelok's. The texts are at the left side of the page, with some remarks on the level of difficulty presented and at the right side there is the corresponding and explained vocabulary. At the end of the book, there is a very good glossary with words that are also important to the understanding of the texts, all this according to strict Latin way of presentations of verbs, nouns and all types of words.The texts are somewhat small but very interesting, both from the point of view of the stories written, all of them taken and adapted to prose from very well-known Latin or even Greek writers (Cicero, Homer, Julius Cesar etcetera). Given the idiosyncracies of the extreme irregular conjugation of verbs in Latin, and this specially from the point of view of the English speaking reader, it is advisable to have as an add-on any of the many good book of Latin verbs, as, for instance, 501 Latin verbs, by Richard Prior &amp; Joseph Wohlberg, which has also a good verb locator.38 Stories is a very good help to any one interested in the Latin language, but it supposes some prior knowledge of the language. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Good reading and Valete!!"

1900621606,A World of Fine Difference: The Social Architecture of a Modern Irish Village,,AWTBPIRJA2XIS,A Addicott,0/0,5.0,1011571200,Unique anthropological study of coastal Irish village,"A World of Fine Difference has been written by an anthropologist who has somehow managed to combine the discipline of his profession with the role of community member, always aware that he is a blow-in and therefore not a true member of the community because he does not possess the necessary local knowledge that would give him the cultural capital he needs to share the sense of place, identity and belonging of the native-born. This may seem an irrelevant point, but it is not. Until you understand why place, identity and belonging are so important to Irish people you will never be able to understand the Irish psyche.Peace calls his study village Inveresk - &quot;the inlet of the fish&quot;. It is a fictional name, as are all the names of the people and some of the other places in the book. It does not matter that Peace cannot identify the actual village, because the social patterns he describes resonate through much of Irish life, rural and urban. Given what he has explained about diversity, Peace is at pains to stress that his study community is unique - hence his &quot;world of fine difference&quot;. The members of Inveresk also see themselves as &quot;a different place altogether&quot; from neighbouring communities, which in turn see Inveresk as &quot;a place full of really queer people&quot;. But Inveresk is not one community, it is three closely-knit, diverse communities; Peace describes them as country, village and pier. Where Inveresk may differ from other similar coastal fishing and farming communities is that each lives cheek by jowl, with the country folk no further than a few miles removed from the pier folk.In Inveresk, Peace shows a community that has no desire to live up to the caricature that rural Ireland is dying or losing its cultural identity to modernity. He writes: &quot;Despite the extent of this sustained induction into modernity, Inveresk retains a strong, indeed pervasive, sense of its own distinct identity, of being a special place in the world. Notwithstanding the many external forces which threaten to breach and subvert it, this sense of distinction is articulated with pride and the residents work hard to sustain it.&quot; So this is a book about a &quot;special&quot; community in rural Ireland, a community that is determined not to lose its distinctiveness, despite the external forces ranged against it, and ready to subvert the very forces that would destroy it for their own ends.Peace argues that the unique community factors which make Inveresk a &quot;special&quot; place may save it from the fate befalling other similar coastal communities. There is, Peace contends, evidence that &quot;recent technological, economic and political developments have encouraged rather than eroded the expression of cultural&quot; diversity, hybridity and creolisation, even if the people of Inveresk themselves are not convinced of this. More significant, Peace argues, is the reality that this small community of 450 adults is aware of possible entrophication, so much that there is a deliberate and conscientious desire to keep &quot;alive the sense of belonging to this particular place at this particular time&quot;. In this regard, Inveresk's strength is the &quot;fierce spirit of egalitarianism&quot; and &quot;almost remorseless opposition to political hierarchy&quot;. In modern Ireland, with few exceptions (Arainn being one), that is not only unique but amazing.In Peace's words Inveresk is &quot;a modern place in a late modern society&quot; yet sadly perhaps &quot;also a distinctively peripheral locale in which, one presumes, the negative effects of global marginalisation should be especially pronounced&quot;. There is little argument that &quot;the inhabitants of Inveresk share a sense of powerlessness in relation to the politics of government concentrated in the metropolitan core&quot;. However that has not stopped this small community of 450 adults from consciously and deliberately attempting to reshape their own small world from within their local environs while keeping an eye on what is going on beyond. As Peace notes: &quot;They may not be successful in some of these efforts; a few may have no impact at all, but that is beside the point. Far from their locality 'moving away from their feet', they remain firmly in command of it and they are proudly aware of the fact.&quot;"

Read it again and again, and more clues are revealed.As far as endings to any book are concerned, they're pretty imprtant, so I won't divulge any details. I will say this though...be prepared!This is whodunnit to the very end, and even though the ending has never changed in the 7 times that I've read it...I'm reading it again for the 8th time right now.Enjoy and share"

Leon ""A reader""",2/2,3.0,1122076800,It's so sad...,"It's just so sad that even in this ""enlightened"" time, women still can't support each other. I saw nothing in MissAnn's review that deserved the attack she received from Jennifer R. And for the record, I would never break previous plans with a good friend just because my boyfriend called me at the last minute, not out of any manipulation or game playing, but simply because that's not what good friends do to each other. And that's not what a man who really loves you expects you to do. It's really pretty much that simple. All the fussing and fighting over it all is pretty silly.I suppose you could say it's all a matter of degrees. There's a fine line between standing up for yourself and just plain being bitter and hateful. You can take it too far, and I don't ever recommend game playing, but it has been my experience from observing what many other women, men truly do take ""nice"" women for granted. I wish I had a dollar bill for every time I've seen a man take a sweet, devoted girl who would do anything for him and cheat on her, lie to her, take advantage of her, break her heart and not even care, only to turn around and fall head over heels with a woman who lives her own life, isn't always available whenever he wants to see her, and basically doesn't let him jerk her around. If what the men here say is true, that this book is bad advice, then maybe one fine gentleman here can explain why time and time again, you dump on sweet girls who love you devoutly for women who make you jump through hoops for their approval?"

Love is difficult enough between the two sexes, with our inherent differences. How much more complicated can it get when it's between men who share the same lack of communication skills and excess of testosterone?If you like your male-male romance to happen between true, grown-up men, this story is for you.

Lovitt ""starmoth""",0/0,3.0,1141689600,"Nice format, but sky maps are over simplified","I thought this book was carrying regional publishing to a bit of an extreme. What's the difference between starwatching in Michigan or say, Wisconsin? Why not buy yourself a Miller Planisphere (much cheaper) and turn the dials to the correct date and time. This will give you a map of the constellations at Latitude 40 degrees North for the exact hour of the year you're star gazing.That said, ""Michigan Starwatch"" is an interesting book and nicely put together: hardbound with a spiral binding, so the pages conveniently lie flat. This is a handy feature when you're outside and trying to use one of the maps to identify constellations. Really, the only item you have to supply is a flashlight with a red filter so you can look at the maps without ruining your night vision.Each of the twelve included maps is set up to be 100% accurate for three hours per year, e.g. the June map is good for 10 P.M. in June, 2 A.M. in April, and 6 A.M. in February. With a planisphere, I can dial up the exact date and time, and it shows a much more complete star map. The maps in ""Michigan Starwatch"" are bigger and easier to read, but the author also eliminated lots of stars and whole constellations for ease of use. This lacuna is okay if you're a beginner and trying to identify the more prominent constellations such as Virgo or Aquila. Once you can make your way around the night sky with ease, then you will want more accurate maps for locating dimmer constellations such as Libra or Ophiuchus.The author's purpose is to ""make the stars your old friends."" The book contains a quick education complete with color photographs and diagrams of what you might see in the night sky: nebulae; galaxies; planets; comets; and meteor showers. Telescopes and astrophotography are briefly covered. There are also modern renditions of the mythology of the constellations, e.g. Hera to Cassiopeia: ""If you think you're so beautiful, I'm going to put you where you can show off your good looks to the whole world every night.""This book is fun to read, and the maps and stories of the individual constellations are loaded with viewing information. The only drawback to its use is that you're going to see many more stars in the night sky than are shown on its twelve maps. The solution is to use a planisphere rather than the maps for advanced viewing."

Wuthering Heights breeds initself a &quot;horror of darkness&quot;, we sometimes breathe in our lives. The love existing between Heathcliff- the most loved villians of all time and Catherine stands strong. This book is about a stranger entering a household where he is rejected, and during this course betrays the one solitary feling in his heart- not being his love for Catherine, but compassion. The other half of the story reaches a point where Heathcliff takes his sweet revenge. There are no answers to questions like: Should a character like Heathcliff exist or not? I do not know. This is a masterpiece in literature depicting love, innocence lost, friendship, forgiveness and above all acceptance. Unfortunately, this was the first and last book of Emily Bronte.

B000EL857U,"City at World's End (Crest Giant, s184)",,A1SLDG8DXDUT4D,Robert,0/1,4.0,1351814400,Twilight Zone meets Star Trek,"This book was pretty good - not great, but it's a pretty good story, and also interesting as a glimpse of sci-fi history.The setup of the story is like something straight out of the Twilight Zone - quiet middle-American town, transported in the blink of an eye into the distant future. The inhabitants quite naturally have a whole range of reactions to this, mostly quite provincial, which sets up the first half of the story: how to survive in this far-future Earth.The second act brings in more of your classic space opera stuff: far-flung galactic federation, faster-than-light travel, aliens, and all kinds of far-out technology, with a conflict that is essentially the little guy vs the big institution. As it plays out, I couldn't help be reminded of all of the original Star Trek episodes where Kirk et al run into various super-advanced races or all-powerful computers, which nonetheless have very human failings, and Kirk makes inspiring speeches pointing out the depravity of the supposedly advanced race or infallible computer (Kirk had a way of getting computers to self-destruct with speeches like this). Or put it a different way, the humans of a million years in the future are ultimately still human. So this is one part of the social commentary of this book.The other part of the social commentary surrounds the reactions of the townsfolk, and the general fear of change, which may manifest as swagger and belligerence. I couldn't help but think of Sinclair Lewis's ""Main Street"", with the smug, self-satisfied townsfolk who are quite happy with things the way they are and endlessly suspicious of things that are presented as improved or advanced - what do I want with a starship when I've got me a Chev-ro-let, that sort of thing. I probably drew the connection to ""Main Street"" because of a couple of the main character's names: Kenniston, and his girlfriend Carol (cf. ""Carol Kennicott""). Maybe just a coincidence... Anyway, fast forward to the 21st century, I would like to think a lot more people would be open to change. When presented with the choice between a dying earth with a dying sun, and a whole universe teeming with life and advanced technology, I'd go with the latter.An interesting point, which is somewhat common to sci-fi of this era, is rather unflattering portrayal of women. The female characters, such as they are, are rather flat and thinly drawn, and not very likeable. Probably intended for a primarily male audience."

B0008EH6LE,The Right Nation: Conservative Power in America,,ALDRY40BPNY09,Scott Walker,0/1,4.0,1260230400,Almost got it,"Much has changed since this book first came out nonetheless, we are a conservative nation and we became a great country because of that. Conservatism that we know today originated in the 1940's. Yes, there were some embarrassing and questionable figures that arose, but a foundation was being laid. The book is very intellectually and professionally written with a Christian moral ideology. Micklethwait and Wooldridge also offer comparisons to the rest of the world. The pages are chock full of numbers and poll data. I skipped over the chapter on the 2004 election, and I would have liked to of seen more concentration on conservative beliefs. There is also a short section dealing with the ""far right"". I very much question their position that it is dangerous or even fascist. Then I would say, it is not conservative or Right any more.The authors are actually very critical of the republicans. They go over some of the contradictions in Republican Party. A good portion is devoted to the last Bush. They also spend some time on the socialist Fabian Society; their power not only influenced the liberals and democrats but also republicans and some conservatives as well. They list out influential conservative magazines, institutes, and think tanks---more than I imagined there were. The authors say they are optimistic for the future of conservative growth.Conservatives deal in absolutes, while the liberal deals in relativism. Conservatism has lead to exeptionalism. Let's keep it that way. We should not be afraid to recognize the United States as exceptional. The authors do make good a point that a majority leans to the right, even democrats. I believe this to be true, but somehow they are being influenced to veer to the left by a few minority liberal fascists. I am curious of what the authors think of our country today."

If a civilian is found with a book, Guy Montag and the other firemen burn it, and the person is sent to jail. All his life Montag had thought burning books was the right thing to do, something to which the world had become accustomed. Then he met 17-year-old Clarisse. She had what was then considered an unusual family. They would just sit and talk for hours at a time. Montag begins to form a friendship with this girl, and comes to believe she has a lot to teach him. Clarisse walks Montag to work everyday, talking to him about many things; her uncle, about how people don't talk about anything, and about the wonder of books. Then, one day, Clarisse disappears. She isn't there when Montag walks to work, making him surprised and confused. After a few days without Clarisse, Montag asks around, and finds out she was killed in a car crash a few days ago. Not having Clarisse to discuss life with causes Guy to wonder, is burning books right? What ideas do these books hold? This story is continued as a trail of where this thought takes him, and of the tragedies and joys that occur because of it. I believe the writing style of this book fits what Ray Bradbury expects life to be like in the future. It seems to be slow, dry, and boring. Bradbury uses detail to the point where it is meaningless. He gives three examples when one would do, and elongates things until they are uninteresting. At one point in the story Montag is sitting in the firehouse, listening to all of the sounds. Bradbury explains about `the flutter of cards, motion of hands, of eyelids, the drone of the time voice in the firehouse ceiling, and the tick of playing cards on the greasy tabletop.' It would have been much easier and quicker to use two examples and get on with the story. No part about the book hooked me, and I had a hard time finishing it. Although the plot was good, this book could easily have been fifty pages shorter. The author is also very repetitive; using the same dry language many times over. Words like pretty, and nice can be found repeatedly as the story progresses. Although I'm not in love with this story, I think it's worth reading. This book made me realize how in America we always talk about being having freedom of speech, but never what we can or can't read. I can't imagine a world where one of the things I love the most was outlawed. Overall, I can't really give this book a number of stars. Scoring Fahrenheit 451 on my enjoyment, it gets about two stars, but on making me think, it gets five."
B000N76ILK,Satanic Verses,,AGXLOJ1GODD03,M. Mazurek,3/3,5.0,1291766400,A Novel About Leaving Home--And About Ten Other Things,"I should get the biggest issue out of the way first. For me, this novel was difficult to read in the sense that it is a challenging novel. There are a few passages in particular which flat out confuse me and I don't know how to read them. This is important for a few reasons. First, this novel is polarizing. Not because of its content, but because some people will either really like it or hate it. They will either love Rushdie's language--like I do--or hate it. This isn't the most difficult novel I have ever read, but it is definitely in the top 3.The main story involves two actors, Gabriel and Saladin, meeting on a plane which is hijacked. After around 100 days, the plane takes off and explodes. However, the two men survive the explosion, the plane ripping open and miraculously manage to land on the ground safely. The two separate after this and there are a few stories within the story of the novel. I think there are about 5 stories in the entire novel, most of which aren't resolved until the last third of the novel.To me this book isn't about one thing. It is about faith, love, family, home, identity, England, immigration, madness, death and revenge. There are multiple interpretations of the events in the novel including who is the hero, the villain and the victim. In fact, the actual ""Satanic verses"" doesn't refer to one specific thing.I think the biggest injustice against this novel is that it isn't all about religion (it is only partially about religion) or some grand critique of religion (it isn't). The first time religion is brought up is when somebody loses his faith and the negative consequences he faces afterwards. The real ""criticism"" of religion, which is actually pretty funny, appears only 200 or so pages into the novel.When I read this novel in a literature class, most of our time was devoted to talking about madness, religion and the fantastical elements, including several instances of magical realism, in the novel. However, while I was interested in those topics, as well as the revenge subplot and identity, I also wanted to talk more about the issues of family and home.You don't need to be a scholar of India to understand and enjoy everything in the novel. Think about it, you don't need to be an expert of Africa to enjoy ""Things Fall Apart"". Are there things I don't understand or didn't catch in the novel? Of course, but it isn't hurtful towards my overall experience. This is a 550 page novel which was rewarding for me with regards to Rushdie's writing style, characters and the themes he tackles. If I missed a historical or cultural reference, so be it, but I don't feel like I'm left in the dark. If anything will do that, it will be what I tried to hint at earlier: the difficulty, the writing style, the ambiguity or the number of different stories in the novel."

B000NWQYM8,Theodore Roosevelt: A Biography,,AU7MW8YQQYHXX,"John A. Van Devender ""Gadfly""",3/3,4.0,1227484800,Just The Facts,"I agree in general with some of the other reviews. I do not believe this biography to be the best I have read on TR but it does fill a niche.Pringle's approach cannot be divorced from the era in which he wrote. In his day Historians supposed they were to be clinical and detached from their subject. There is no warmth in the writing and the great and small episodes in TR's life are dealt with in about equal measure. It is hard to justify the detail omitted in TR's pathway to San Juan hill in comparison to the nitty gritty stuff that is included about his political tiffs with some of the bosses.So, in general I would say that I prefer Edmund Morris' work to Pringles. Having said that though, this book acquaints the reader with the politics of the US at the turn of the century in an eye opening manner. Modern issues such as bail outs of credit institutions are mirrored in the early 1900's and interestingly, with the same arguments. Much of what passes for ""progressive"" today is found there. TR in Pringle's depiction is passionate but prone to much less of a consistent principled stance than presented by others. The truth is probably somewhere in between but Pringle's analysis is a needed balance to other, more sympathetic depictions.So... good read... a bit of a struggle in spots... but worth the investment."
B000GK17RY,Boy,,A25ACLV5KPB4W,"Matt Hetling ""Matt""",0/0,5.0,1109808000,The magic of the man behind the magic,"This is a terrific early non-fiction book for readers who are ready to move on to more adult reading, but who aren't willing to give up the delicious fun that Roald Dahl provides us.Boy is a selection of stories from Dahl's childhood. As he does with anything he writes, he has taken out all of the boring bits, and left the most shocking and intriguing parts behind to tell his story.Children and adults alike will be alternately delighted and horrified (or, even more often, delightedly horrified) by the true stories from Dahl's childhood, which range from the Great Mouse Plot to a graphic look at the beatings he and other students endured at the hands of their boarding-school administrators and peers.We also get to see the most barbaric side of early medical practice, as every doctor who makes a brief appearance in the book seems hell-bent on causing the patient as much pain and suffering as can be imagined.We can see Dahl's childhood memories as he sees them, and there are many obvious starting points for some of his most famous (and less famous) stories. The beating that Danny, Champion of the World, endures is alluded to, as is the strong Norwegian grandmother character from The Witches, among others.This is not a definitive biography by any means; rather, this is a pleasant jaunt through a series of interesting stories that have the added benefit of teaching us a little more about the man behind some of the most beloved books of his time.I enjoyed this tremendously as a tween, and I still enjoy it today. Highly recommended."

I don't like I ever loved one of Koontz's characters as much as I loved Odd. Unlike most Koontz books, this book is more of a love story that is surrounded by paranormal activity rather than a story of paranormal activity that includes a love story. I don't think I ever felt so emotionally connected to a Koontz character before. The pure and honest love story here was a delight and the story surrounding the couple kept me on the edge of my seat and constantly guessing as is typical for Koontz books. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a good book and not just a suspense/paranormal thriller."

B000K1V2D8,The End of History and the Last Man,,A25DEUH9C802KR,"Christopher M. Williams ""BulgarianPoke""",17/23,5.0,1110931200,Thought provoking.....for those who actually read it.,"Anyone looking to load your arsenal with talking points about the virtues democracy and capitalism, or looking to unearth the secret, zealous neo-con conspiracy behind President Bush's foreign policy should NOT read this book. However, if you want to encounter a challenging thesis on the nature of man, and the way that he orders his social life, this should be right up your alley.The book begins in taking on our 20th century (or at least pre-89) pessimistic belief that man does not progress. He might be capable of build new toys, but his social existence is static, that is to say, violent. This outlook, of course, is the product of the 20th century tragdies that proceeded 19th century exuberance. Fukuyama argues that now is the time to reevaluate our pessimism. He then argues that the invention of the scientific method has set in motion a series of events, and changed our way of thought in such a way that we can never go back. Thus, History was born. He then argues that inevitable improvments in science, in turn, improve technology. The state will then seek to utilize that technology to its benefit on the battlefield. Those technologies will soon spill over to the nation's entire economic system where it stimulates economic growth. Thus, this economic mechanism eventually drives society to industrialization.But industrialization only gets man rich, not democratic. Man has a built-in need for recognition, an irrational need to prove himself, his ""glory"", to humanity. In what we know as the ""state of nature"", man did this violently, or else he was enslaved. This arrangment of masters and slave, or kings and serfs, was secure until economic progress fundementally and irreversable changed our societal make up. Man is not satisfied with merely become rich, he wants have dignity, or rather, he wants to be equal. While other economic systems can provide certain levels prosperity (his comments on communism might surpise some), unless man is provided a place to compete and be ""recognized"" as man, money isn't enough. A liberal democracy is the end point of that demand and best provides for that outlet in man. Thus, the economic mechanism of capitalism grafts onto mans desire for ""recognition"" and, voila, we have Democratic Capitalism.Beyond this linear arguement, there are many other interesting discussions on how our new view of history affects foriegn policy and how man may settle into this final stage. And while liberal democracy achieves a philosophical coherence that cannot be surpassed, there are causes for concern. Fukuyama's discussion of these are sobering. There is an inherent tension between mans desire for recognition (that is, to be distinguished) and society's emphasis on equality. Fukuyama presents the ""last man"" as exhausted, not triumphant.One would think that a book where Hegel, Plato, and Nietzche are the stars of the show might be a bit dry. Not at all. I found the book both informative and enjoyable. Fukuyama's prose and organization are tight, readable, and sometimes witty.Those who argue that this book is a work of ""American triumphalism"" in the wake of the fall of 1989 either has not read the book, or willfully misrepresents it. The same goes for those who sneeringly dismiss it after 9/11. He bends over backwards to emphasize that historical events will not end. He even shows how a liberal democracy might even slip back into some previous form of government. Howevever, what is central to this book, is that our system won't evolve philosophically. A different government will always be one from the past (Islamic facism is no philosophical progression, but rather a throwback to earlier thought that we evove from because of its blaring conradiction). Further, the triumphalist charge is particularly weird being that this is a Hegelian argument liberal democracy was inevitable for mankind. America was the result, not the cause of History. Sorry, but Reagan is never even mentioned.Essentially this book forces you to ask yourself, if liberal democracy isn't for everyone, or isn't the best, what would a perferable political order look like? I have yet to hear someone argue for an altogether new system (Fukuyama points out that he hasn't either), no matter the length of one's list of liberal democracies' shortcomings. The End of History gives an answer for why this is the case."

The discussion is sometimes hard - so hard that one of the partipicipants in the conference withdraw her contribution as a protest against one of the papers in the book! As I see it, the main difference in the discussion about ancient goddess religion is between those scholars who accept the evidence for a goddess religion and those who try to explain it away. Both these positions are well represented in this book. On one hand we have scholars like Christina Biaggi who begin from the archaeological evidence and try to interpret it - on the other hand we have those like Brian Hayden who are engaging in a frenzied polemic against all those who argue for a goddess religion. Hayden is an interesting example of academic denial - he could be seen as an almost archetypical case!The book can be recommended for those who likes to read different opinions on this interesting subject and compare them."

It is more like a Greek tragedy or Shakespearean tragedy. The characters are larger than life and the events of the book mythic in scale. Nevertheless, just like with, say, Macbeth I was drawn into the plot and actually found myself getting angry and upset about the turn of events. So I got my money's worth. Hardy definitely has cast this story very darkly. Tess is no mere innocent victim. And Alec is not so clearly just an evil villian. Nor is Angel an angel. The characters are complex and deep, and the reader ends up caring about them. That's why this book is a classic. See the A&amp;E adaptation in film for a fascinating and moving interpretation."

It's really amazing how incredibly tolerant he was given the times. While the Russians were carrying out pogroms against Jews because of their intolerance, Mill was able to provide an intellectual defense for tolerating the emerging Latter Day Saints (despite his obvious dislike for them). The beauty of this book is that the arguments are still relevant and directly applicable to the issues. Whereas Marx required armies of Soviet intellectuals in order to stay relevant, you can pick up On Liberty and fully appreciate the arguments.

It is very specific: a book to teach you how to use Reiki to change your core beliefs about abundance and lack. It is NOT a book designed to teach you about Reiki itself. Reiki cannot be learned from a book (Diane Stein's teachings notwithstanding, see my Amazon.com review of her book.) It IS a book to teach those who are already Reiki practitioners to use Reiki to change their lives.All too many of us carry negative beliefs about money and our right to abundance. Many of us were taught that money is &quot;bad&quot;, that only those who are not spiritual will have abundance. What nonsense! Spirit wishes us to live life with abundance, it is our birthright (see Lee Carroll's Kryon books for more info on this topic.) Horan's book provides a step-by-step program which, if followed, will disolve blockages in your life and allow the natural abundance of the universe to flow through it.I followed the program, and the changes in my life were amazing. Not overnight, but substantial nonetheless. The most important part was the change in my mental attitude, and how my life flowed from that. If you are already a Reiki practitioner who wants to change their life, buy this book! If you're interested in learning more about Reiki, find a good Master/Teacher in your area and seek training from them. A teacher is vital, you cannot learn it alone. But once learned, the changes in your life will astound you! I have been praticing Reiki since 1994, and have been a traditionally trained Master/Teacher since 1998.

B000NU0RZA,The Transall Saga,,A28NKG7RQYI71U,CoolTigersRule,0/0,4.0,1145836800,Mark the Adventurous Camper,"The book that I read was Transall Saga by Gary Paulsen. This book is about a boy named Mark who went camping with his family. While he was camping he heard a noise, and went to go see what it was. When he got closer he found out that it was a rattle snake, and he got to close and jumped back. He landed in a blue transporter and when he landed, he realized he was in a totally different planet. At this different planet he was looking for people and he saw all these people. He found out it was a tribe, because they captured him and they made him help them. Mark started asking the tribe about this transporter and they said it only bring you back when it wants to bring you back.I liked Transall Saga overall because I thought it was very exciting. This book was also by Gary Paulsen and I have always liked his books because they have a lot of action. The part I liked the most was when Mark was in the transporter and didn't no where he was.I also had some dislikes for my book and one of my dislikes was in some parts of the book it was confusing. Another was when Mark jumped back and fell into the transporter; I thought it could have had more detail.I would recommend this book to boys who like Gary Paulsen. I would also give this book to boys between the age of twelve and fifteen. Boys would also like this book if they like reading action or adventurous stories."

The depth of the author's research was not only readable but believable in every sense. Historically the Bible is in itself fascinating. Reading about Jacob his wifes Leah and Rachel and what signifigance their lives had on history as a whole is very well told here. I truely wish more had been written about Leah's daughter Dinah. The Biblical records were indeed sketchy at best. Here Diamant can only guess what happened. Her take on what could have happened is plausible. Reading about ancient culture in novel form sure makes for fun reading. I really enjoyed this book and actually learned plenty in the process of reading it. I highly recommend it.

Finally, I bought the book and just read it, and there are few books as written as well as this.I had to, however, not give it the 5 stars it surely deserves because it can be a tough read. It's an old book, so the prose is &quot;dated.&quot; It can also be very historical at times, delving into pasts far from the present, and never to be spoken of again.But THAT'S what makes this such an engrossing tale...the histories. Everything from Bilbo's songs to the story of Strider's sword add to each beings personality and give them a life that few modern writers can achieve.And the images Tolkien can conjure span many generations and are as individual as the person reading it. He gives enough information of the Shire and Rivendale and Bree and everywhere else to form an idea, but not so much so that he corners you into seeing what the next person sees. The many interpretations of Frodo himself are testement to this.If you want something to read in two days, grab a Brooks novel, if you want something you can read again and again and get something new from it each time, I highly recommend this."

So it is quite a treat for me to sit down and enjoy what our Irish cousins have already been treated to....a collection of many of her columns which have appeared in the Irish Times newspaper. This may be old hat to Dubliners, but it's a newfound treasure for most Americans.The book is like a box of chocolates and each short read is a tasty little morsel to devour and enjoy. What a treat it is to get this inside look at one of my favorite authors and share in her musings on just about everything. How does it feel to see someone actually purchase your book? How did she get the background material for Sushi? What was the nicest time of her life? How did it feel to be at a book signing for Rachel's Holiday and have no one show up? What are her feelings on shoes, Catholicism, real estate agents, and a whole lot more.My personal favorite was &quot;Happy Christmas! Form An Orderly Queue&quot; not only because I love to read any work set at Christmastime but because of the glimpse it gives us into Marian's family life which just had to have been the basis for the wild and whacky Walsh clan of many of her novels.If you love Marian Keyes already or if you just like short humorous pieces to make you laugh out loud, I highly recommend this one."

Well-researched accounts about life during the pandemic fill the first chapters of the book. Gripped by the story, I read on eagerly into all hours of the night waiting for the chapter on the investigation of the miners bodies sealed in the permafrost I had followed carefully on the news.As I finished that account, I became concerned; I was almost out of pages and the author had yet to draw the story together. But I pressed on and found that the story just suddenly stopped; as if she had run out of material or energy.Clearly there are no conclusions about the 1918 pandemic at this time, but I would have expected the author to do a better job summarizing the story; perhaps at least a summary of what little we do know. But Gina Kolata quickly wraps up her book and leaves the reader hanging. It really feels like she just got tired and gave up.It is an okay book and will remain in my permanent library. But it could have been so much better if she had written the second half.UPDATE: I recently re-read this book and have lowered my rating to two stars. The book ""just stops""."

Multi-level marketers, get rich quick schemers (without working hard), hucksters, con-people, politicians, late night info commercial people, and many others may have used these genetic defects to make money, gain power, or accumulate fame. What are the defects? Gullibility, naivety, dishonesty, personal greed (something for nothing), blind loyalty to a cause or person, hunger for power, laziness, and more.Mr. Stossel gives good critical thinking advice to his ""students"". It is a great book for the young but others can always use a bit of practice when it comes to critical thinking skills. Learning to see through the ""words"" of politicians, salespeople, advertising messages, and much more is a really good idea! Here are some of the tips that will inoculate you against con artists and others that want to use you and/or take your money:* Listen to what people say but watch what they do* You are not going to get something for nothing* It is OK to dream but wakeup before you commit* When someone speaks in vague generalities or just""generally disagrees"" with you, ask for a specific example ofwhere they disagree or where you are wrong. If they can'tcome up with a specific example or incorrect assertion youmade, get out the shovel!* Don't ""buy"" one side of any story before you evaluate theother side of the story* Don't ""buy"" one side of the story forever! Keep evaluating!What is true today may not be true tomorrow.* There are often hidden reasons for actions others take,appraise their intentionsThere is much more of value in the book. It is the kind of book you can read in short sessions of 10 to 20 minutes while you commute to work on mass transit or perhaps a washroom reader. Mr. Stossel breaks it up into short readable sections.I must address some of the reader reviews of this book. Some reviewers gave the book a dreadful review. These reviewers resort to name calling and accuse the author of lying and spreading propaganda. These accusers are demonstrating one of the human defects, blind loyalty to a cause or even dishonesty. I wish they would come up with a few examples of incorrect information or propaganda. I don't think they can! I read the entire book and can not find any misinformation in this work.

But Ned Beaumont (nee Schoenberg?) gets fixed up as a special investigator to look into the murder of the Senator's son. Ned tracks down the bookmaker who welshed and skipped town, and uses &quot;the hat trick&quot; to claim his winnings; money is power. Afterwards he acts like a private detective as well as a political crony. Disagreeing with Paul Madvig, he meets Shad O'Rory; Shad tries bribery and torture to get Ned to betray his friend Paul. Ned escapes this trap, and helps to solve the murder of an eye-witness. In telling this, the book shows how a newspaper can slant the news: &quot;they wouldn't print it if it wasn't true&quot;!This novel seems to be a variation on Hammett's detective stories, using &quot;politics&quot; as the &quot;root of evil&quot;. But there is a relationship between political power and the love of money. This book shows government functioning as a feudal system: a ruler accepts loyalty from his subjects, and in turn helps and supports them. But the ruler may accept an election loss if that will punish disloyalty and keep his personal power. Could a blue-blooded aristocratic politician sacrifice his son, pimp his daughter, and attempt murder to keep political power? You can judge how this novel approximates the real world. (The book mentions that New York is a train ride away; does this imply Albany or Philadelphia?)"

It is a little bigger than its 702 pages would suggest, because it is printed on thick glossy paper in quite a good printing quality. The illustrations are in a style reminiscent of years long gone by (all B&W;).The chapter on wood consists of two sections. The first contains descriptions of some thirty trees: fairly elaborate botanical description, brief characterization of wood type, a few words on the use made of the wood and a listing of archaeological finds. For the anatomical description the reader is referred to a work that (finally) appeared as ""Plants in Archaeology"". It is obvious that not much research has been done on the wood in Ancient Egyptian objects. The second section deals with the technology (joints) and tools used by the Egyptians: a much more limited topic and one lending itself well to an overview."

Whereas ""East of Eden"" or ""Of Mice and Men"" provide the reader with beautifully rich characters wrapped in poetic narrative, ""The Winter of Our Discontent"" offers an expanded cast encased in a comparatively mediocre prose.Ethan Hawley--grocery store clerk, heir of a small town American legacy, father, husband, and friend--is the books sole intriguing character. Tempted by greed, lust, violence, and crime--through which he skates unscathed-- Ethan's struggles lead to his near suicide which is prevented by love for his daughter and a desire to see his name thrive.Ethan's relationship with and attitude toward his children is where this story shines. This alone makes it a novel worth reading. He is brutal in pointing out his children's flaws, but constant in his love and devotion towards them.Overall, not my favorite Steinbeck, but it was surely interesting. The few brilliantly poetic sentences interspersed in passable prose kept me reading.Yes, I will deign to give this book a completely subjective letter grade: B+."

Her books will last. They will be treasured and re-read for years.

Out of the first four books of the ""trilogy in five parts"" (I haven't read the last one yet), this one is by far the least engaging. As short as it is, it took me three days to read it because I found it difficult to absorb. There is a mere skeleton of a plot line, which might have taken all of five pages to tell if not for all of the meandering and weaving around the story line. Much of what happens throughout the story has little to do with what the characters set out to accomplish. I know that this is characteristic of the Hitchhiker series, but at least in the other books, the meandering and going off on tangents leads to a funny occurrence, or is at least humorous in itself. I didn't get anything like that out of this book. While there are a few funny lines in it, it hardly stands out in my mind as a good read."

I have read Alex Cross and also some independent novels by Patterson and besides the same ability to create great characters you might not recognize that this is the same author. This novel is certainly written for younger viewers but I think even adults that are fans of a nice clean action packed story will get a big kick out of this book.While this is not the normal Patterson novel I think if you are a fan you will get a kick out of this novel.

9997532864,Three Score and Ten,,A38V7798CGX2SR,Martha Schroeder,9/9,3.0,1126915200,Not Quite Our Angela,"Three Score & Ten is the last in Angela Thirkell's famed Barsetshire series of novels. Ms. Thirkell died before finishing it, and it was finished by one of her friends. The difference shows, and it is instructive. Angela Thirkell was the mistress of light, slightly ironic prose. The world her characters inhabited probably seemed old fashioned sixty years ago when she wrote them. Her style was uniquely her own. She seemed to go off on tangents (divigations, she called them) yet they always illuminated her characters and the story she was telling. The divigations are here but instead of a souffle lightness, they are heavy and show the effort that went into them. The characters are not quite as silly and literate as they were when Thirkell's effortless erudition created their dialogue. Still, this is Barsetshire, and all the familiar faces are here--for what clearly Thirkell herself knew would be the last time.Even though not vintage Thirkell, such a visit is well worth the time."
B0007DLN74,The magus (A Dell book),,A2CZQJX3V1VKNQ,"""subornator""",3/4,5.0,1032480000,From Island to Island,"The Russian translation of ""The Magus"" (a truly excellent work by Boris Kuzminsky) came at a right time - when my generation was exactly the main character's age. At twenty or thirty his problems and torments would seem equally artificial. At twenty-five, they happened to be very much in resonance with what was going on in our very different lives.I had a personal reason for a special treatment of this novel. I had a feeling that Nicolas Urfe was very much like me - psychologically and intellectually. I easily identified myself with most of his reactions. I felt that he read, joked, ate, smoked the way I did.I have now re-read the novel - though not the second, amended variant (which was the source for the Russian translation), but the original one. Several years ago I found myself in an English-speaking intellectual company, and the participants in the chat cordially agreed that the second variant of ""The Magus"" stunk, while the first, on the contrary, ruled. I was intrigued; I still am. Unless my memory is playing some major trick on me, the changes in the second variant were mainly cosmetic. A couple of erotic scenes, no more. The main difference seemed to be the fact that the mysterious Lily (or whatever) gave in to Nicholas in the second draft, while in the original version she had remained a teaser par excellence. Probably as one grows older, the relativity of sexual and other feelings becomes less and less surprising. But it does not signify any serious change.It became much harder to sympathise with the main character after these several years. His subtlety is now perceived as snobbery and showing off. During the first read I felt irritated that Nicholas was not ready to face a miracle and looked for a rational explanation for everything. I am even more irritated now. It is especially revolting that in the long run he turns out to be right.I also feel a larger cultural difference between myself and Nicholas Urfe. I did not notice then how much he reflected on his englishness, how consistently distanced himself, an islander, from the Continent; how he mused - in these terms - about the game, forced upon him by the European, Maurice ""The Magus"" Conchis, how his hate of fascism was based on the idea that Europe could have produced such monsters, while England could not. If we think of this detail of the British national psyche, it is usually in an ironic context, while in fact a Shakespearean drama lingers beneath.The Greek island of Phraxos, the main location of the novel, is a different story. It is hard to imagine someone so unemotional who would not want to go to Greece immediately after reading ""The Magus"". Fowles does not seem to be saying anything new - everyone knows about the sea, sun, pines and ancient statues - but one cannot help but feel the obsession which this nature and this country impose upon you. In ""Daniel Martin"", Fowles does the same trick with Egypt, Syria and New Mexico. He is an absolutely stunning travel writer.One critic rightly remarked that Fowles's best novels possess an old-time quality: the reader can literally sink into them and live inside until the last page is turned. ""The Magus"" displays this quality to an amazing degree. Especially if read at the right age."

1582344256,Why Read?,,A18OBUSMXVE8R0,J. Guild,3/3,3.0,1231545600,I suspect that most teachers would love this book.,"I read this book hoping to find some answers to the question ""Why Read?;but found it to be too preoccupied with reading from the perspective of a teacher. What makes any teacher more qualified to instruct one as to what they should read? I have read a lot in my lifetime and have benefited greatly from it. My father read a great deal and was extremely well versed on a wide range of subjects,particularly current events and politics.More so, than the vast majority of the teachers I came across in school and university;and he didn't have the opportunity to complete high school,let alone attend university. I guess I developed my love of reading from him and spent endless hours as a youth reading the family's Book of Knowledge and any other book I could obtain.What about school ,university and ""english teachers""? Well,to be quite frank about it;they tended to turn me off reading,and particularly the books and authors they talked about in their courses.I had no interest in authors such as Scott,Dickens,Kipling and the literature of England and English Literature;as if the only english literature worth reading or poetry such as Tenneson,Byron,and other European poets were what was important. I was more interested in Mark Twain or the poetry of Robert Service;but they seemed to be beneath what academics thought important.In other words,teachers tended to turn me off reading much more than inspired me.I have discussed this with many people over the years and have found that many lifelong readers agree with me;but obviously not teachers.It is not an easy thing to create an interest in other people and I have concluded that this is done by inspiring them as opposed to ""teaching"" which tends to be more a process of instructing and correction.One day ,while on a boat,I spent a couple of hours discussing this with a retired university president. I suggested to him ,that in all the teachers I encountered in school and university;I found only one or two that ever ""inspired"" me,and I thought that was what a good teacher should do.I expected he would disagree with me,but his response was,""If you had more than one,consider yoursely very lucky.The one teacher that stood out, taught high school Mathematics and Science. He had to quit Medicine due to back injuries.He inspired me in several ways. We were studying Logs and I was very impressed with them.I was telling him how much I was impressed with what one could do with them and he reached into his desk and pulled out a Slide Rule and asked me if I ever saw one of them.I thought it looked like some kind of a fancy ruler.He explained how it was basically a set of Log tables on a sliding stick and showed me how you could multiply and divide with it .He loaned it,and an instruction book to me,and I learned to use it .I was the only kid in the high school that could use a slide rule.Back to reading.I didn't care much for the type of books the teachers taugh us about,but on my own I ""found"" much to read ,and quickly read everything I could find by John Steinbeck;after stumbling upon ""Cannery Row"" and ""Grapes of Wrath"".I read ""Teacher Man"" by Frank Mc Court and found it a marvelous book.Now there is a teacher I would have loved to have had and I am sure he was inspiring to his students. How he fit in to the academic establishment and how he comes across to the conventional teacher ,is another matter."
B000K0HXHI,The Cruel Sea,,A4L4BYJPD385J,Leo Champion,3/3,5.0,1129593600,Brilliantly-done military fiction by a guy who's been there.,"I read a lot of military fiction, ranging from ""it's all glory"" stuff by people who've never heard a shot fired in anger but wish they had, by ""it's all hell"" stuff by people who've never heard a shot fired in anger but are trying to send a message. Somewhere in the middle, with a bit of both aspects and a lot of experience, are the relatively few novels written by guys who've been there, writing from experience about situations that closely paralleled what they went through - a bit of hell, a bit of glory, and a lot of detail.The Cruel Sea sits near the top of the latter category. Nicholas Monsarrat was a journalist who was commissioned into the Navy at the start of World War 2 and spent his war on small ships, fighting German submarines in the Battle of the Atlantic. The main character of The Cruel Sea, Keith Lockhart, is a journalist who was commissioned into the Navy at the start of World War 2 and...It's a first-rate book. Even without Monsarrat's biography, it's obvious that he knows what he's talking about; it shows in the details. Most military fiction has a certain amount of scenes away from the front, dealing with the main characters' personal lives; The Cruel Sea has the same, and does it excellently... by no means glamorously (there's one particular thread, about a lieutenant's unfaithful wife, that is the antithesis of glamor), but very realistically; the scenes don't seem at all tacked on ""to give the fighting men a human side"", but feel like - and are - an integral part of the book. The characters are the same people in a London bar or in the middle of the Atlantic; you get the feeling that most of the people, and most of the incidents, are based on real people and situations that Monsarrat either knew or knew of, during his time in the war.A certain, very small, percentage of military fiction transcends the ""military"" label - fiction about people, in a military situation. The combat isn't the focus of the story; it's simply a part of it. Life at sea and character development take precedence over fast-moving plots; there are, realistically, no individual bad guys (how many soldiers or sailors know the names of the men on the other side?), but the work is executed well enough that a plot would feel irrelevant.I've read hundreds of books of military fiction. A bare handful are as good as this one. Thoroughly and absolutely recommended."

0694514519,The Winter's Tale,,A1W1ONKNMIHP99,MrSherlockHolmes,6/15,3.0,1069113600,The high price of Jealousy,"Ask anyone to name a play by Shakespeare and it most likely will be Romeo and Juliet, or Hamlet, or Macbeth or even Othello. Rarely will you ever hear anyone say The Winter's tale, but is its lack of popularity due to it being any lesser than Shakespeare's other works? Unfortunately I would have to say yes.The play is taken from Greene's Pandosto and follows it quite closely in most parts. The plot is fairly simple, Leontes, the King of Sicilia gets into a jealous rage over his what he believes is his wife's infidelity with his friend. This causes him to break off a close relationship with his childhood friend the King of Bohemia and his servant Camillo. He also banishes his daughter, and kills his wife and son by flouting Apollo's judgement that Hermione, his wife, is innocent.The second part of the play is concerned with the reunion of his banished daughter and her newly acquired husband with Leontes. There is a surprise at the ending which I will not spoil for those who have not yet had the opportunity to read the play.If you've read Othello, you will find similarities between Othello and Leontes and also between Desdemona and Hermione. The only major difference is that there is no Iago in this play; Leontes is his own Iago. Shakespeare in Othello develops the reasons for Othello's suspicion of Desdemona, unfortunately this is lacking in The Winter's Tale. There is not much of a motive and the reader (or audience) is asked to believe that Leontes develops his jealous rage over one minor incident and almost immediately.Another problem I have with this play is with the surprise ending. Here again, there is not much of a clue as to how this happens, it is just assumed that we will accept it unquestioningly as fact. Apart from these minor `faults' the play is still an interesting read, and as always the inclusion of the clowns and Autolycus give it some lightness which balances the tragedies.If you'd like to dive deeper into the play, I'd suggest the commentary by Fitzroy Pyle (1969) which I found to be quite helpful."

I found the book to be very intresting in both area's. Anne Rice has a fabulus talent with bringing a character to life on the page while at the same time painting a realistic canvas for that character to live around. I found that the many thought provoking ideas about God vs. Devil, Good vs. Evil, right vs. Wronge were all captured beautifully and let me look at these ideas of life in a completly and sometimes desturbing way. But by fare the biggest grabe that the book gives to the reader is its facinating characters: from the charming and villanis Lestat to the contimplative and regretful Louis and the woman within the child that we come to know as Claudia. The relationships that each character shares with the others is also fasinating. Mostly shown in a sexual way, Louis and Lestat both are attracted to Claudia and it is left up to the reader to truely discover how fare they all went with those feelings and the relationships between Lestat and Louis or Armond and Louis. Overall I found this book to be intresting and an inthrolling read that I couldn't put down. However though, I do not think that it is the world changing event that some fans make it out to be. Read for pleasure, but don't expect the world to change."

1881085007,The Quran & the Bible in the Light of History & Science,,,,47/64,5.0,933984000,Blows the detractors away-and they can't stand it!,"Deserves More than 5 Stars!!! Being the professional doctor he is,Dr.Campbell not only saves people from death or eliminates the diseases inflicting sick people. In this book, he skilfully saves readers from the mental paralysis and ill informed presumptions and the misguided prejudices propogated by Bucaille-and Muslims. Campbell skillfully dismantles the many, many false assumptions and mis-interpretations that Bucaille uses as a platform to build his laughable theories about Christianity and the Bible on. So, reacting to this, those with the 'poison' in their minds are reeling from the purgative effects this adept rebuttal has upon those who have been drinking from the well dug by Bucaille. Dr.Campbell, who spent a good number of years in research before writing this book in response, also knows Arabic; and has also personally studied the Quran and the Bible. He also has referred advice from experts in several fields ie.Astronomy, Geology and human Embryology, in order to maintain factual accuracy. And even though he himself knows the arabic language personally, he has asked other men for whom Arabic is their native language, to assess and critique his word studies in that language. Such consistent thoroughness and detail study has resulted in a volume that critically examines and looks at the problems the Quran has with scientific anatomy, embryology and genetics as well as historical problems with fables, allegories and languages. This itself is just the tip of the ice-berg. Dr.Campbell strove to be faithful to factual accuracy in all other areas addressed in this book besides the above. This can only be due to the Doctor's disciplined eye for detail and the scholar's concern for truthful representation of the facts. Those,like the previous reviewer who have nothing left to say factually to Dr.Campbell's systematic response; resort to cowardly insinuations on his character like his alleged 'jealousy..' and so forth. Such character assasination have nothing to do with the truth and the facts of the case presented in this volume but is instead a desperate effort to divert the readers' attention away from the facts;to a fictional and baseless flaw alleged upon the writer's personality. Unfortunately desperate people have to clutch at whatever straws they can find to keep them from drowning! Because in the end the joke is squarely on Bucaille's books. That is what the detractors want so badly to prevent you from finding out..!!"

Broken up into three sections investigating, respectively, the marijuana industry, migrant farm labor and pornography, this book is actually very readable. A lot of the book tells short biographies of people affected by either government policy or big business in the various industries. I especially liked the section on migrant labor, which focuses primarily on the Santa Maria Valley in California, where my mother grew up. I got bogged down in the pornography section, by far the longest part of the book, and could have been edited a little more. I also found parts of the narrative could be preachy and sensationalist, but you learn more than you ever thought possible about the underground economy."

B000J0U8XA,Ararat,,,,23/23,5.0,933292800,Her Best Work,"Probably the most influential book of poetry published in the language in the last two decades; solidified (and spawned a generation of mimics of) what is now widely recognized as The Gluck Style: spare, unblinking but not unflinching, tough, mournful, deceptively simple. The book, rightfully, that all her other books (except The Wild Iris) may be judged. &quot;Long ago I was wounded..&quot; it begins. Gluck turns away from alluding to a specific mythology (though she runs back to it in Meadowlands and Vita Nova; though, in fact, Ararat itself is a Jewish myth) to read the mythology of domesticity: her father the hero, her sister the Fury, her mother like Dido, herself like Euridice, whose only hope of escaping is to turn completely away. But Gluck was &quot;born to a vocation,&quot; to bear witness to the great and ordinary mysteries, the death of her father, the death of a sister, the ache and hunger repeated infinitely within her drama of four, the view of her family that will reduce her to ashes in the act of witnessing. &quot;Like Adam, I was the firstborn. Believe me, you never heal. You never forget the ache in your side where something was taken to make another person.&quot; She accomplishes all: poetry, drama, narrative. And somehow she escapes the cheap glamour of confessional poetry. These are painfully honest pieces that she somehow also keeps at arm's length, to examine like an artifact. By all means, read this book. The language and imagery and syntax are easy, unintimidating, and then you realize that she has laid out quite plainly the way people love and harbor and reject one another. &quot;Long ago, I was wounded. I thought that pain meant I was not loved. It meant I loved.&quot;"

Bellamy,0/0,5.0,1340928000,This book started me down the L'Amour trail.,"There are enough reviews here about ""Comstock Lode"" that you might think you know the story well enough to skip the book. But, if you like westerns at all, or even think you might, this book will turn you into a L'Amour fan.I picked it up after seeing it on a rack not too long after we had returned from a trip to Reno. While we were there, we visited Virginia City and discovered, much to our joy, that it looks and feels very nearly as it must have in the latter 1800's. It's located away from Reno and Carson City, up on a mountainside that looks out over miles of desert. It still has the old Victorian buildings and boardwalk main drag. There is virtually no structure that will remind you that it's not 1875 or so. The only difference between it and a Hollywood version is that it now sports a paved road through town. Move off the main drag just one street and you're likely to find yourself on an old mining claim or near a real working mining operation. So, if you decide to read the book, you might want to Google Earth Virginia City to get a sense of what it was like in context of the book.So, ""Comstock Lode"" was a particularly interesting story to read since I had such a complete mental picture of Virginia City going in. I could still taste the dust, feel the wind and remember what it felt like to sit in one of the the saloons. What really made it interesting though, were the stories about the history of Virginia City, it's businesses and characters that L'Amour no doubt modeled, at least in part, on real places, events and people that occurred and existed around that time in history.To date, I have read more than 28 L'Amour books since ""Comstock Lode"" and have four new ones already on hand. Every one has been total entertainment and I plan to reread ""Comstock Lode"" when my daughter and her family finishes it. I loved Larry McMurtry's ""Lonesome Dove"" and recently read one of Wm. W. Johnstone's books, ""Screaming Eagles"", but L'Amour is the master, IMO, and this has to be one of his best."

The book is designed to be used by mental health care professionals, and I most certainly encourage them to purchase this book for a family treatment plan that will benefit their clients and the client's family. The approach of the therapy takes the entire family into consideration. It is not just the individual with bipolar that goes through the trauma, but the entire family. The therapy educates the patient and the family as to the disorder and its' attributes, gives the family ways of coping with the disorder and hospitalization, works on medicinal compliance, and prepares the client and the family for any future episodes. Most importantly, it improves the communication of the family which leads to a healthier environment for the client as well as the family. This book is a definite must have for mental health care providers as well as clients and their families. Excellent Job Dr. Miklowitz.

This book continues right from where that one ended and features a pretty strong beginning dealing with the effects of Rand using the Power and what help/hindrance he can expect from the Aes Sedai. But soon after that the problems start. The horn that he just got back is stolen, along with the knife that Mat needs to be restored to health. Naturally Rand has to go help look for these instead of running away and evading his fate as the Dragon Reborn. All this is dealt with by chapter 10. The book concludes with Rand rescuing the girls from a race of men from across the sea who enslave Aes Sedai. This plot point starts on chapter 40. You may begin to see the problem here. In case you're wondering, yes they do spend the middle 30 chapters wandering around the woods looking for that dang horn. That and deciding which dinner invitations to turn down. Riveting.The padding in this book is unnecessary and excessive. There are over 600 pages here when the plot really only needs half that. So much of this material is a waste. At one point Loial makes a staff, which they describe in some detail, only to discard it unused two chapters later. Why? What was the point of describing that? It's not as if this material is character development either since Rand's entire arc goes 'no no, I won't be manipulated' and never really gets much further than repetitions on that theme until the very end. The first ten chapters are important. The last ten chapters are important. Why did we have to have thirty chapters of fluff in between? There's nothing there that can justify more than five or maybe ten. I understand that this only gets worse later on in the series. It must be a danger inherent in these long new fantasy series since Martin'sA Feast for CrowsandA Dance with Dragonsboth fall into this same trap: Excessive verbiage, underdeveloped plot.Another problem that was gnawing at me in the last book was the underdeveloped characters. Well here it really hits. The three Emond's Fielders are as dull as ever, and so are all their travel companions with the exception of Moiraine and Thom, both of whom merit little more than cameos. The relationship issue hits quite hard here with a full four girls competing for Rand's attention. This is made extra annoying for two reasons: 1. Rand never does anything but try and ignore it. He doesn't even reject any of them. The reason behind this is largely due to: 2. The boys and the girls spend most of the book apart. This doesn't stop the girls from constantly going on about how great Rand is, even those who only knew him for a few minutes. Rand is starting to become the most obnoxious kind of Peggy Sue character and it's really annoying. All the relationship malarchy just seems childish and while Jordan has thus far been able to cover this by continuously repeating ta'veren and the threads of fate, it's starting to wear pretty thin. I really do hope it improves in future books.So why, given the strongly negative tone of this review, do I still give the book three stars? Because the first and last ten chapters are truly excellent. The threat to Rand's soul is very real, even if it's overmentioned, and the twists of fate that bring Rand towards his destiny are fascinating. When the book is good, it's good. There can be no question. If Jordan had only managed to trim down the middle 3/5s to a manageable number then this book would earn five stars. As it is I recommend reading it with a lot of creative skimming.The story continues inThe Dragon Reborn. Hopefully (given the title) this will contain more of what made the last book so good. And maybe we'll actually get to see Rand being decisive for a change."

Usually these books are populated with quirky people, all of whom have interesting secrets and almost all of whom the reader cheers on. The mysteries themselves may not always be deep, but generally they are intriguing and somehow linked to Alaska's traditions.But Play With Fire was a major disappointment. The bashing of Christianity was peurile, offensive, and stereotypical with not an ounce of nuance to moderate a viewpoint that seems to come straight from today's headlines. In these books, Shugak is always depicted as a thoughtful and intelligent woman who thinks for herself and appreciates many viewpoints. Not so in this book. After she has her conversation with the aging university professor about evangelical Christianity, she thinks to herself that she is ""so glad she had this conversation"". But there is no nothing in that conversation that we haven't seen untutored TV pundits scream at each other! After reading that chapter I said to myself ""That's it? Christians are haters, think only of themselves, and want to kill you if you don't agree with them?""Interesting writing about mushrooms, and Jack is a dreamboat, but this is one Shugak book that is headed for the recycling bin."
0060197986,Wild Thorn,,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,Michael Butts,1/2,4.0,1060905600,TAME THORN,"One cannot dispute the writing skills of William Hoffman; he has a stunning sense of character, place and time. Unfortunately, his laconic, laid back style hinders the suspense in this novel. Charley's back (from &quot;Tidewater Blood&quot;), and his character is not one of my favorites. Although he was done wrong in the first book by his own family, his retreat into a fantasy, anchorite's world only makes him irritating. His desire to leave the world behind, live in the wild and avoid people may be idealistic but still unrealistic, too. He's hooked up with Blackie, a woman with a criminal record, and his relationship with her forms a strong foundation for what drives a lot of the story. The mystery surrounding the mysterious death of Aunt Jessie takes a back seat to Charley's own obstinance and lack of perception. His sudden act of infidelity only shows how shallow he can be, and his decision to keep it from Blackie leads to the inevitable dissolution of their relationship. It doesn't take long to figure out the culprits in this one.Although not an exceptional book, Hoffman's skills make it one worth reading; let's hope he picks up the pace in future novels."

Celine, and his Journey. The subject, here...Buk and Fante, they were great writers. But Celine got it. He captured it. And put it there, on the page, like some angry magician; what they were all after. As close to, something, as it can get. Some little piece - valuable, but dangerous; that no one since Dostoevsky had fiddled with. A story about a war. About love, rejection. The crummy soul of man. And the things, out there, that no one else wanted to talk about. The loneliness. The quietness of the night. The stuff that Shakespeare molded over, into a beautiful story. Like massaging a turd. No, Bill! Something's not right. Life is... ya know. Life is that goblin that was hiding underneath your bed the whole time, as a kid. And here Celine takes the flashlight to it. Sure, it's horrifying; but it's still there. Just the same. Might as well invite it up for coffee, or tea. Become acquainted. Before it jumps upon you....Other days, I'll pick it up. Read a couple of lines, here or there. Sometimes giggling. Sometimes stunned. Celine's writing is a style unlike most. Each paragraph sits there, on the page, reading like the dying gasps of a heart attack victim. The book is somewhat auto-biographical. Written through the cynical imagination of his character, Bardamu. A medical doctor, of sort. Celine doesn't use chapter numbers. And the crawl through the night undergoes a number of stark scenery shifts. Starting in that cafe terrace, speaking with his friend. All the way through the Congo, the Ford factories in Detroit, before landing back in France. In that miserably described Rancy.I would never call it a challenging read. But one that is challenging, for some. In another way. Ya really got be able to cut the fluff, to give it a fulfilling attempt. You gotta give thought, that we may just be walking and crapping things. Which is hard, for some.But, despite popular opinion pronouncing his evilness, Celine turned out to be a pretty funny guy. Which ok's him in my book. World War II was his joke, back at the world. ""Fine world, you want me to become something, after all of my fussing. Squirming. And pointing out of your absurdity? Fine. How is this? I will become an anti-Semitic, Nazi enthusiast. How's that?""A great writer. But a better book.Caught up in some of the darker moments of Mankind. One of the deadliest times, for their games. During a time when, no one was capable of judging another. Until it passed over them. And a winner declared.At the end of the night, survival only waits.Now go read it."

However, I do recognize that most people buy the books for patterns. With all that said I will attempt to give an overview and then will offer my opinion. The quality of the example pictures is superb, with no distortions, no fuzzy spots and no glare. The examples themselves range from good beading quality to excellent quality. The pattern graphs are very clear, easy to read and if you have the skillset above, easy to understand. There is at least one example of each pattern set. There are simple and glancing directions at the beginning on the stitches used and a few comments and anecdotes, otherwise there is little text in the book.Now for my opinions, I would have liked more examples as I was looking for endings, edges, inspiration on fringe, etc. So for me it was lacking a bit in the finished example section or could have included a gallery which I would have liked even better. I like to know the stories behind the inspiration for pieces so the lack of text was another drawback. Neither was major hence the starrage given."

My favorite of the three is Amok, about a German doctor in a Dutch colony who makes crucial choices about the life of a wealthy woman and, in turn, his own. The Royal Game is Nazi-era literature, but unlike anything else I've ever read of the period.

B000N5HIZC,Physics: Principles with Applications: International Edition,,,,14/17,2.0,934416000,Mediocre textbook at best,"Even though this textbook is now in its 5th edition, most users of the book will find it sorely lacking in many respects. First, the writing style is dry and sleep inducing. The sign of superior textbooks is that they anticpate the reader's questions and answers them right on the spot with a diagram or more explanations. Books that have this clairvoyant insight are the ones that are true gems. This book does not do that all. The author makes no attempt to infuse personality or interest into the material. It would have been more interesting if the author had inserted personal comments such as how to remember a formula(mnemonics), words of encouragement, cartoons, comics, MORE analogies, anything to diversify the presenation and keep me interested. Instead, he piles fact upon fact upon fact. Gee how captivating? Instead of lecturing to the reader, how about engaging the reader in dialogue? Reading you book is a relationship that's going to last a whole school year..why not make it fun? Second, I found the derivations of formulas to be very difficult to follow at times. I think it's because of the eye-straining font and the fact that the text is all in black print. Equations in the text shouldn't be boldened even blacker but set off in a different color and derived in one space instead of having words placed between them. Third, I got the impression that the author was writing the book more for physics professors than for novice students. In the front cover, the author brags about how over 150 college professors have thoroughly reviewed the book over the span of the five editions. Well, that's nice but it would have been way more beneficial if 150 *beginning* students had reviewed it instead of teachers. What's the point of giving a book for review to someone who has had already mastered the subject? Those who have mastery over a subject cannot remember the difficulties and frustrations when they were first learning the material. In fact, in his introduction, the author write a long intro on how teachers should use the book; excuse me, but your book is not written for teachers, but for students. The book is for FIRST time students, not teachers. Well since teachers determine which textbooks to adopt, the author had no choice but to cater to their demands. WRONG!! Fourth, the author leaves the reader hanging by not including the answers to the conceptual questions. I think even more important than solving numerical problems is understanding the conceptual questions. well it would have been nice to include the damn answers. Fifth, the text has this elitist attitude that seems to engulf it. For example, he suggests that the hardest problems, those he rated level III, should be &quot;reserved for only the best students.&quot; Such a distinction does not serve to encourage hard work. I thought to myself, &quot;Man I must be a bad student because I can't answer most of the level III problems. I've read the chapter several times, worked the beginning level I and II problems but I just can't answer these level III ones..ok the author wins..you've stumped me..there does that make you happy now?&quot; His attitude should be more encouraging. Offer us hints or ideas instead of forcing us to reinvent the wheel. I know you don't want to spoon feed physics, but leaving me hanging and frustrated like a battered puppy won't do the trick. Sixth, the author offers *no* guidance as to which of the end of chapter problems should be mastered. Instead, he just throws a whole bunch of problems--in fact over 100 questions per chapter. Now these aren't easy questions. Most questions take about 2 to 3 minutes to answer. I want to know of these hundred of problems which I should concentrate my time to do my best on tests. Most students are using the book to prepare for AP exams and mcats. The author gloats that there are 3100 questions. Realistically, should I struggle through 3100 questions to get the essence of physics? Give me a break. Realize who your audience is for the book. Teachers will find it useful; your audience, the students, will not. In conclusion, I found this book to be boring, unhelpful, and tedious. The book basically hits you unmercifully over with facts until you doze off into sleep or throw the book against the wall in frustration. Physics teachers will enjoy reading this book; the rest of us will find it more useful to stay far, far away. And you know what, that's a shame because physics is interesting but this book does no justice to such a wonderful subject."

0939495864,A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man,,A2YXRT2XIJIO57,John P. Jones III,1/1,5.0,1345161600,"""Welcome, O Life!""...","So concludes James Joyce, with the subject quote, in this Irish coming-of-age novel. I first read this novel a few decades ago, and felt it deserved a re-read, in particular, to contrast it with other novels in this genre. Most recently, I've read the Norwegian novelist, Per Petterson'sIt's Fine By Me. There is also the classic French workLe grand Meaulnes., and, for better or worse, the AmericanThe Catcher in the Rye. In terms of Joyce, I'd also read his stream-of-consciousness masterpieceUlysses. A re-read of that should await at least a first reading ofThe Dubliners, if notFinnegans Wake (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin).In approaching this novel, the ""reference frame"" of the reader will be a dominant consideration: practicing Catholic, or, ex-Catholic, or, never-once-was a Catholic. Because, unlike the other three coming-of-age novels mentioned above, religious dogma, in the form of Catholic beliefs, permeates this work. Naturally, the anticipation, and reality of sex makes more than a cameo appearance. There are the shifting relationships with parents and adults as one moves toward become their coeval (Stephan visits his father' childhood home of Cork, with him, and his father treats him more as a brother). And there are the forms, and reality of obtaining an education, dominated by the schools and professional educators.Stephan Dedalus is the character that largely serves as James Joyce's alter-ego. The novel commences in his infancy, with a nursery rhyme meant to instill fear, and therefore obedience: ""Or, if not, the eagles will come and pull out his eyes."" A fitting prelude to the religious dogma that promotes so much of the same. The next section depicts boarding school scenes, the austerity and coldness of life, the spectrum of teachers who seek to guide, influence, or impose their will on the children. I thought the Christmas holiday scene, when Stephan is first at home, especially apt, since it illustrated the sharp gender division related to the Catholic Church, unsurprising, perhaps, to anyone who has attended one of their services, particularly in Europe. In a later scene, Dedalus is wrongly punished by a rector. The young lad, despite possible dire consequences, reports the rector to his superior, and enjoys a modest triumph of righteousness.For me, the climactic scene occurred half-way through the novel. At the age of 16, Stephan succumbs to the temptations of the flesh, on a commercial basis, and then is immediately tormented with his ""mortal sin,"" and the ever-so-graphic depictions of eternal torment that are promoted by Church officials. The only ""salvation"" is confession, and he must muster the courage to tell a complete stranger what an abysmal sinner he is. As an ex-Catholic, this sequence of events resonated, as did terms I had not thought about in a long time, like the difference between ""actual"" and ""sanctifying"" grace. Stephan's burden of eternal damnation is, at least temporarily, removed, and he does so well in his true contrition, (contrition that transcends mere fear of eternal damnation) that he is approached by one of the priests in order to discuss the possibility that he has a priestly vocation (yes, the ""join the brotherhood"" pitch).But a scene of a young woman, gazing out to sea, with comely legs, deters Dedalus from thoughts of permanent abstention. In a passage that anticipates another famous one fromUlysses, Joyce writes: ""Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life! A wild angel had appeared to him, the angel of mortal youth and beauty, an envoy from the fair courts of life, to throw open before him in an instant of ecstasy the gates of all the ways of error and glory. On and on and on and on!""I'll give Joyce a hearty amen, from the amen corner. 5-stars."

Yes, the creepy cover gets even creepier after you've read the story.But it's not Alan Moore's best work, it's not the best Batman story ever, and it's not the best Joker story ever.Yes, Moore and Bolland do a wonderful job of depicting the Joker's worldview and giving us insight into his motivations by fleshing out his origin. Yes, the Joker is so twisted that you'll find yourself agape at the perversions he thinks are humorous. And yes, his cry of &quot;see what one day can do to a man&quot; gives him a previously unrevealed pathos.But the story is sticky and difficult to slog through--it dawdles along and then comes to a complete stop when Moore indulges himself in something that he should have known wouldn't work in a comic book: the Joker sings. Page after page after page, the Joker sings about what it means to be insane and how you can be insane too if you just let yourself. It didn't work for me, and after two pages, I just started skimming the words and concentrating on the pictures. I may be recalling this incorrectly, but there's nothing happening in the panels while the Joker drones on and on that couldn't be depicted in a panel or two.

B00005X479,"Walden : or, Life in the woods",,A2N3YAM4K3ATM,-_Tim_-,17/21,3.0,1122681600,Walden,"Henry David Thoreau's _Walden_ is an account of a young man's sojourn in the New England woods, a critique of modern society (in the 1840s), and a call to action to vegetarians, libertarians, and other free thinkers. Thoreau's account is highly idiosyncratic and obscure. To be honest, it is a chore to read it through to the end. But Thoreau is wise on some subjects and, even better, he is funny. He is also very quotable, as this review demonstrates excessively.Thoreau begins _Walden_ with a scathing depiction of the senseless, directionless activity of modern life:""Most men, even in this comparatively free country, through mere ignorance and mistake, are so occupied with the factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them.""And:""Men labor under a mistake. The better part of the man is soon plowed into the soil for compost. By a seeming fate, commonly called necessity, they are employed, as it says in an old book, laying up treasures which moth and rust will corrupt and thieves break through and steal. It is a fool's life, as they will find when they get to the end of it, if not before.""Instead of working harder to produce more, Thoreau decides to want less, and leaves corrupt society behind to live at Walden Pond. There, he takes refuge in naturalism. He plants a crop of beans, he takes long walks, he observes the animals that share his woods, and he engages in some amateurish scientific speculation. Thoreau is not a hermit: he often visits the village of Concord, Massachusetts, and enjoys visiting with infrequent visitors at Walden Pond. But he finds that a little bit of society can go a long way:""We meet at very short intervals, not having had time to acquire any new value for each other. We meet at meals three times a day, and give each other a new taste of that old musty cheese that we are. We have had to agree on a certain set of rules, called etiquette and politeness, to make this frequent meeting tolerable and that we need not come to open war. ... We live thick and are in each other's way, and stumble over one another, and I think that we thus lose some respect for one another. Certainly less frequency would suffice for all important and hearty communications. ... It would be better if there were but one inhabitant to a square mile, as where I live.""One of my favorite passages in the book describes the author as he leaves behind the brightly lit village and walks home through the woods alone to his cabin:""It was very pleasant, when I stayed late in town, to launch myself into the night, especially if it was dark and tempestuous, and set sail from some bright village parlor or lecture room, with a bag of rye or Indian meal upon my shoulder, for my snug harbor in the woods, having made all tight without and withdrawn under hatches with a merry crew of thoughts, leaving only my outer man at the helm, or even tying up the helm when it was plain sailing. I had many a genial thought by the cabin fire ""as I sailed."" I was never cast away nor distressed in any weather, though I encountered some severe storms. It is darker in the woods, even in common nights, than most suppose. I frequently had to look up at the opening between the trees above the path in order to learn my route, and, where there was no cart-path, to feel with my feet the faint track which I had worn, or steer by the known relation of particular trees which I felt with my hands, passing between two pines for instance, not more than eighteen inches apart, in the midst of the woods, invariably, in the darkest night.""After a minute description of his life at Walden, extending over the bulk of the book, Thoreau suddenly tires of that part of the narrative and decides to fast forward a bit in what I think is the funniest paragraph in the book:""Thus was my first year's life in the woods completed; and the second year was similar to it. I finally left Walden September 6th, 1847.""In the last part of the book, ""On the Duty of Civil Disobedience,"" Thoreau expresses a radical libertarianism:""I heartily accept the motto, -- 'That government is best which governs least'; and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe, -- 'That government is best which governs not at all'; and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have.""An opponent of the war with Mexico and the institution of slavery, Thoreau decides to do something about it, and lands in jail for refusing to pay a poll tax. In life as in politics, Thoreau advocates a life of deliberation followed by action:""There are nowadays professors of philosophy, but not philosophers. ... To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust. It is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically, but practically."""

I absolutely loved this story and the writing was so beautiful and thought provoking and I immediately thought to myself &#34;THIS is what a writer should 'sound' like&#34;. I want my daughter to read it because I take away from the story that it is okay to be yourself, to be humble but proud of being who you are. To be true to yourself and be strong and though difficulties come your way, you can and will get through them. I wish I had read it when younger and had made it a part of my references as I grew and to have it to fall back on in my mind but I didn't but I am sure glad I have finally read it and now I look forward to also watching a movie about it that I found :).

So to all you non-believing pricks out there who want to know the truth i'll let you figure out which one it is. This biography is very well written and very emotionally touching. It is a very sweet and caring account of the Jim that most of the public did not know and still seems largely ignorant of. I have read all of the other books on Jim Morrison and this one is definitely at the top of the list. Another thing, pretty much everything Jim wrote or sang about had at least two meanings. What makes you think that LA Woman was ONLY about Los Angeles ? In reality it also means Linda Ascroft...his &quot;little L.A. Woman&quot;...the little 5'3&quot; sweet thing who was his true love. Courson and Kennealy were vultures by comparison, Pam was the only real gold-digger. The only &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; was Jim's own Romeo-and-Juliet flawed Love for Pamela...that in the end destroyed him...anyone who really knew Jim would know this... he was the victim of his own heart and love... Love was the only thing he believed in, that is why he never owned a house and just traveled from hotel room to hotel room like a nomad. He didn't believe in money or possessions or the &quot;things&quot; of this world. WAKE UP !"

When the Germans attack, Erik finds himself with Tamera and some of his friends, lost in the forest. Will they find saftey? Will they die?

Without a corpse in sight, the book may not appeal to many readers of grity detective novels, but this mystery is solved with wit, wisdom, and Vergil. For what more could one ask?_Gaudy_Night_ is eriudite as well as entertaining, standing up well to the passing of over six decades. The themes of academia versus business, career versus marriage, and town versus university are still alive today. The writing of Dorothy L.

By now everyone knows that young Dorian makes a childish wish that a beautiful portrait of his should age in his stead, and that he should remain forever young and vibrant, and somehow this wish is granted. What follows is a tale of increasing debauchery and depravity that poison a man's soul, while leaving no visible clue upon his face.This is not the most entertaining or gripping novel that you will ever read. Far from it, in fact, but the real merits of the novel come not from the action and plot, but from the extremely clever dialogue and the shredding social commentary. (not surprisingly, this novel took a long time to get published, and was later used as evidence against Wilde during his trial for indecency) Wilde takes several shots at the aristocracy, especially their values, as well as art itself, hedonism, and the very concept of morality.Perhaps the finest aspect of the novel are Wilde's quotes, often through his favorite mouthpiece: Lord Henry Wotton. Henry serves as a goad to Dorian through all of his excesses, and he waxes philosophical upon almost any subject that he can get anyone to listen to. He's wonderful and horrible all at once, and best of all, he doesn't even believe half of what he says. This is definitely a 'classic' novel, and well worth the read. Again, if you're expecting high paced action you'd probably best look elsewhere, but if you're in the mood to think a bit, then chances are you'll enjoy &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;."

She can be so detailed in her descriptions and focus on minute items and spend pages and pages on them. I happen to love the way she writes, but understand that many people do not have the patience to deal with this.I can see how diehard fans of JCO resent her for writing this novel. I can also see how this book was chosen to be an Oprah selection. I got through its 454 pages at times loving it and at times hoping for a near end. Here's the positives:The demise of the family has a very karmic feel to it. Corinne comes through as a very haughty woman despite her Christian beliefs. Michael Sr. places a very high value on status, and wants to be accepted by those he perceives as ""worthy"". If Corinne had been a little bit more like Michael and viceversa, the family would have survived (and then we would have no book!).There is a big element of surprise throughout the story. When you think it cannot possibly get any worse, it does.Character development is perfect, to the point that you get to intimately know everybody in the book. The parents and the children all have important roles, except for Michael Jr., the least relevant.Horror is a difficult genre. For horror to be truly successful, it must be unexpected. The banishment of Marianne by her loving and adoring parents after her rape is one of the most horrific moments in JCO's works. What exquisite cruelty! Michael Sr., himself banished from his family and deeply hurt by it, inflicts the same pain on his own fresh and blood.Here's the negatives:The book started great, but lost momentum at the end. I was particularly disappointed with the last scene, the 4th of July reunion. JCO is far more sinister than that, but maybe she is tired of writing high-caliber literature that does not have a huge following, and decided to show everybody that she too can write an Oprah bestseller. Good for her.I have a hard time accepting poor grammar and punctuation, even when it is used for the sake of reality. In this case it doesn't fly. Judd is the narrator, and he is a newspaper editor. It is not inconceivable to expect perfect punctuation from him, yet at times commas shine in their absence.All in all, a keeper."

Harris finds a way for us to empathize with Hannibal and endure our disgust for such a man at the same time. Hannibal's love of the fine arts and instinct of knowing what a woman likes, paints a romantic picture of the cannibal.The depiction of Hannibal's fate by Mason Verger, if he were captured alive, is brutally gruesome and strangely justified that my heart beats with anticipation wanting and not wanting it to happen. I beg to know where Clarice will stand when the showdown begins and ultimately am dissapointed in the ending.Harris shows his ability as a skilled writer by making readers want to cheer for the bad guy and despise the ones who are seeking justice.I think 7 years was worth the wait for this fabulous book, but the last few chapters leave much to be desired.

B000P03ZR0,A PATCHWORK PLANET.,,A3RQCTEMPG0ZZR,Sheldon S. Kohn,5/5,5.0,978998400,A Meditation on the Effects of Time,"I have long been a fan of Ann Tyler's work, and she continues to amaze me. In ""A Patchwork Planet,"" Ms. Tyler offers another in her long line of unforgettable dysfunctional families. Thematically, she makes time, its effects and illusions, a center of her meditations.As I read through the text, I found myself thinking a lot about the effects that time has on families. In Barnaby Gaitlin, her protagonist in this tale, we find an unpromising man who is stuck in time so far as his family is concerned. His adolescent exploits into juvenile delinquency provided some of the glue that cemented his place in the family as its problem, its focus of problems, its excuse for staying stuck as the years pass by them all. Through the course of the narrative, Barnaby attempts to extricate himself from this stuck position. His efforts to change his life are made concrete through the process of paying back money to his parents. We see yet again that beliefs are almost never challenged by facts, and almost never displaced by another's actions.The wonderful cast of elderly characters that comprise Barnaby's clients for his job with Rent-A-Back display another side of time. Any and all human battles against time are futile. One of the most interesting aspects of this novel is seeing the way that people cope with the inevitable diminished abilities that are a part of aging. If we are lucky enough to have a long life, we will all eventually be included among those ""old people.""Sophie, Barnaby's girlfriend, serves as his ""angel,"" in line with a Gaitlin family tradition. As such, she shows why it is never a good idea to ask an angel to stay. Sophie refuses to struggle with time and change, preferring to sacrifice her money more than her heart. Through Sophie, we see how we could have lost the truth left in the wake of those who came into our lives briefly and departed quickly. Such people often effect us most deeply; sometimes they completely change our direction in life. Such encounters hold only time enough for possibility and no time at all for the mundane disappointments that mark all our closest relationships. In the end, perhaps we should rejoice that our angels left us as quickly as they did.I have noticed that in each of Ms. Tyler's books there is a short passage or moment that remains with me long after I finish the book. In ""The Accidental Tourist"" it is a short passage in which one of the cousins asks Macon if his dead son will forgive him for forgetting what he looked like. In this book, there is a short passage in which Martine, Barnaby's Amazonian female partner at Rent-A-Back, describes being surrounded by children who think that she is old. It's a touching description of the surprise that one must feel when one realizes that one is old, more powerful because it is framed by one who eschews both tradition and weakness.""A Patchwork Planet"" is highly recommended. It's a keeper, as are all of Ann Tyler's books."
1563898047,Swamp Thing Vol. 5: Earth to Earth,,A2B9Y0WXNSN17U,doomsdayer520,18/18,5.0,1052524800,His Blue Heaven,"If you've read the prior collections in this series and you thought things couldn't get any better, well you ain't seen nothing yet. This installment of the Swamp Thing graphic novel series contains just six issues from Alan Moore's run (#51-56), but that does include the double-sized blockbuster issue #53. In any case, quantity is meaningless here because Moore and his artistic team have reached the dizzying heights of their powers, unleashing the most mindboggling and gutwrenching stories in comic history. The basic subplot running through the series at this point is Abby's arrest for immoral conduct while Swamp Thing was off saving the universe, and her escape to Gotham City. As Swampy is searching for his true love, she is being held by the authorities in Gotham. In the overwhelming ""Garden of Earthly Delights"" (issue #53) Swamp Thing unleashes his full elemental powers on the uncaring city that imprisons his lover, and even temporarily defeats Batman in the process. Sadly, Swampy is supposedly assassinated by government agents, and finds his spirit floating in outer space. This is where Moore's imagination really goes into overdrive, giving us the highly unique and moving story ""My Blue Heaven"" (issue #56), a tremendous tale of loneliness and soul-searching, where Swamp Thing is blue in more ways than one. This episode is also another pinnacle for the artistic team, and much credit must go to colorist Tatjana Wood for her moody and unconventional work. By this point regular artists Stephen Bissette and John Totleben had mostly moved on - Bissette was only doing the covers and Totleben's only major contribution is ""Garden of Earthly Delights."" The artistic torch had been passed to the outstanding team of Rick Veitch and Alfredo Alcala, who barely miss a beat in keeping the series' haunting and lovely artwork rolling. The only sad thing about this edition of the Swamp Thing series is that fact that Moore's run would soon come to a close."
B000FELJBU,Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories for Late At Night,,A3GEMZIWRR48Q0,lisa,8/9,5.0,1318204800,Simply magnificent,"The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood was recommended to me by a friend, and I was bowled over by the novel. I devoured it in a few days (a feat itself as I have a youngish family) and was left with that sad feeling, an almost a bereft feeling, I get when finishing a truly great novel.In this dystopian alternative present, Offred is a handmaid, assigned to a Commander and his `infertile' wife. Her only reason to live, to be allowed to live, is for procreation. In the land of Gilead, once the United States, women have been suppressed almost entirely. Eyes watch for anyone behaving out of the allowed norms that have been established, and punishment is either execution, to later be hung on display on the wall surrounding the centre of Gilead, or to be sent to the poisoned and radioactive lands and for an untimely and painful death. For now, Offred is avoiding the latter fate, but only by performing a monthly ceremony, the culmination of which involves the Commander inseminating her.But her time is running short. If she does not fall pregnant soon, she will be sent to the poisoned lands in disgrace. When she continually fails to fall pregnant, Offred, aided by the Commander's wife, looks elsewhere for viable sperm.What stayed with me after finishing this novel, other than the desperate need to find out the rest of her tale, and my feeling of abandonment by the author in not finishing the handmaid's tale (she left me hungering for more, much more), was the method in which the book was ended. Without giving too much more away, I was offended by the documentary style finish. Not offended as in unhappy with the author, but offended by the last characters I met. How dare they refer to Offred so casually, laugh at her issues, make light of her life. She had become very real to me, and I wanted to stick up for her pain, her solitude, all she gave up to become a handmaid.What I came away with was a better sense of my own past, of the real people who have lived through adversity, a bigger respect for their struggles and their courage for these real people who made their real stories known. I still hunger to know what happened next, and probably will for some time yet. One thing I do know, I will be thinking about this novel for a long time."

B000MRYGRY,GINGER: MY STORY (INSCRIBED),,A4ECYB20UWH3N,"R. Bono ""Riccardo""",11/13,5.0,1231977600,In Her Own Words,"I found this book to be delightful. I'm not taken aback by the use of the first person pronoun, or the comments on Christian Science, or her bursts of enthusiasm that come through from many years ago. In fact, they enhance understanding of this ebullient and hard-working personality. She's open about her flaws and imperfections...and in fact, seems eager to communicate them to the public....who, seeing her in more than a few transcendentally beautiful films, had come to expect the same from her in person. She demonstrates her down-home humanity and her joy of life many times over...even as she attempts to set the record straight, on all the so many erroneous things, that were said about her over the years.She's quiet on certain (but not all) personal things...i.e., between husband and wife....and I'm glad she had the good taste NOT to let us in on the things that are none of our business. She was more of a private person...like Fred...than many would have supposed. She was active socially at different parts of her life, but always preferred the small gathering, or the small party, with friends.Some viewed her as an ""ultra-conservative"". But here too, she sets the record straight. She only supported her mother's right to speak out regarding her opinions on left influence of some Hollywood script writers. It should be noted however, that this was at the very moment when the theft of American atom bomb secrets led to an exact copy, being detonated by Mr. Stalin. Compare Ginger's ""sin"" to Kate Hepburn's melodramatic and simplistic ""I am a communist"" speech in their support. I'm not disparaging Kate at all, but truly, which was worse?She wasn't so ""ultra-conservative"" not to have met and admired Democrats FDR, Elinor Roosevelt, Harry Truman (who had a day for her in Independence, Missouri), and Jimmy Carter. She wasn't so ""ultra-conservative"" to have broken her engagement with a cheating Howard Hughes, and turned away from a life of wealth and luxury. She wasn't so ""ultra-conservative"" not to have married a pacifist, and to have considered as her favorite film, Hollywood's first anti-war movie: ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", starring her future husband Lew Ayres. She wasn't so ""ultra conservative"" not to have been a fighter for her own rights, and the rights of actresses. And in fact, it should be noted that her friend and colleague, Ronald Reagan, with whom, in 1950, she did the anti Klu Klux Klan film ""Storm Warning"", helped to end the cold war, with Mickhail Gorbachev...whom HE befriended.Underlying her great talent, charm, personality, versatility, and good looks, she had a strength of character, which earned her every bit of her many accolades. Yes, she admittedly and not surprisingly, also made mistakes, both professional and personal...but...and this is key to understanding her...bounced back every time. She didn't live in a dream world of her brilliant past career...but lived in the moment...even if that moment was not up to her highest past standards...as is almost always inevitable in late career.In my opinion, this did not diminish her one iota. As Billy Wilder said...""We are all as good as the best things we've done."" If this is the standard, and I think it is, then Ginger Rogers must be ranked very highly indeed. Her dance musicals, her dramatic acting, and her skills as a first rate comedienne, her stage musicals, all place her in the category of a classic Hollywood legend.She was a hard working actress, who loved her audiences; quietly took care of her family and charities; transcended her mid-West background to become a woman of the world; and who never took out a loan in her life. Fred Astaire had a three word description of her spunk. Fred simply said: ""She had guts."". That's Ginger Rogers. I recognize the quality of her life....and I recommend this book highly."

I will continue to read this wonderful little book. Like most of Bradbury's work, one can never get bored reading his stories. His stories are at times terrible, dark and they are beautiful, fascinating and in many ways a portal to the future. They are also a wonderful escape from the now.The Illustrated Man is more a short story collection woven together by a central theme. The theme is The Illustrated Man. I agree with many other persons that it is important to realize he is illustrated, not tattooed. And how did he get the illustrations? A witch did the illustrations. He has been on the road searching for her ever since she put them on every inch of his flesh. When he finds her, he plans to kill her. Why? The illustrations are magical and move on his body. They are magic. If you look at theme for a period, they will tell you a story.The Illustrated Man moves through 18 stories. ""The Veldt"" is my favorite story. ""The Veldt"" is one of the best short stories ever written. I also enjoyed ""The Long Rain"" (about rain of Venus) and ""Marionettes, Inc."" (about an artificial intelligence body double being used where a man can go out on the town, but the double ultimately taking the man's place and wife). There are so many great stories ranging from Sci-Fi to mild horror. It is a great book I would recommend for all middle school age and older.Read and Reviewed by Jimmie A. Kepler."
B000H7EO2G,The Lord of the Rings Trilogy 3 Volumes,,AKHIMDX94U8OK,Joshua Chimene,2/3,5.0,1239494400,wonderful buy,"When my copy of Lord of the Rings started to fall apart from reading and age (they were circa 1975) I took up the task of finding a replacement copy. This is the first one i saw and it struck me on a level I couldn't describe. I kept looking at other copies but this edition grabbed me. However the reviews worried me: not real leather but cheap cardboard, bad case for the book, etc. However after seeing a very recent review that those problems were with an earlier printing I bit the bullet and bought it. When it arrived I realized that it was NOT cheap material but rather very supple, wonderful to the touch and actually changes from a blue tint to a slight marbled green when shifted in the light. The gild on the pages is a nice touch and the maps inside are wonderfully detailed. Two things I can't get over, and something that many true book lovers will appreciate. One, it smells wonderful. Not old book amazing, but still very good. Two, the pages are smooth like the cover but not onion page brittle: it feels like its meant to be read.One important thing to remember is to be VERY VERY SLOW in unfolding the maps, they can tear due to the way they are folded in the book. They also used a kind of adhesive to hold the map pages together so again, be VERY VERY SLOW and you'll be fine.Unlike most I won't even dare to summarize the story or plot as this space would hardly do it justice. Just trust me that if you like fantasy stories, get ready for (quite literally) the grand daddy of all of them. You don't really get a much more epic story then this that don't feel stretched, already done, or convoluted.All in all it's a delight to have on my shelf as well as to read. The construction is wonderful, the thought to editing the text is careful and well done, and it is visually captivating but at the same time toned down. It is a book that I will no doubt read to my children when they are young and then leave to them when that unfortunate time comes.And yes, the pictures do NOT do it justice."

0380794934,The Calcutta Chromosome,,AUEY946M1L939,"John L Murphy ""Fionnch""",0/0,3.0,1341532800,"Promising if uneven ""what if"" medical-conspiracy thriller","I've been assigned a course with this as required reading, so I anticipate my students will share the challenges I encountered. It took me quite a few hours to read this three-hundred page novel, as it demands close attention. I kept notes as I went, for the chapters follow three paths in uneven and unpredictable portions: it centers around the near-future NYC of Antar, who investigates via the computer network he nicknames Ada the disappearance in 1995 Calcutta of a fellow employee of his firm. He found a bit of Murugan's i.d. card in an online archeological sift and so the hunt's on.Murugan, an irritating windbag who speaks in an affected hip-slang that is at least the novel's most memorable phrasing, as it crams a century of English jive and pose into a whirligig of a vocal register, finds his obsession with the real-life Ronald Ross, who took credit for malaria research earning him a Nobel Prize early in that same last century, overwhelming him, up to the mid-1990s. As a third setting, we witness Ross's discovery a hundred years before as it unfolds, with more than a little help from if not his friends than his pair of comely confidantes in Calcutta. One young woman wants to escape her suffocating home life there, and his quest to learn about the origins of the ""Calcutta chromosome"" and its apparent triumph of the powers of Silence over those of the Abyss (alluded to more than explained!) draws her in.Their interest is echoed in a tangent that takes the plot into haunted territory explored by a predecessor, who goes by the pen-name Phulboni. I won't tell too much about his own embedded tale, but it does stand out as a self-contained strong point. Much of the prose, outside of the windbag Phulboni (I think he was meant to sound as such!) and the importuning, brusquely buttonholing Murugan, comes via the more sedate search conducted by the low-key, and self-effacing Antar. This accounts for the lassitude of much of the story, as his sections while moving the plot forward the most for all their domination as a central protagonist often lack the verve of the Indian characters' sharper dialogue and brasher bickering.Later in the story, amidst a lot of medical characters from Britain and America, and many supporting roles (Romen especially) who gain sketchier mention, the convoluted plot careening between these three main time frames (and more scenes spin off of these, not always conveyed in the clearest manner, as didactic explanations must help the reader along by expository passages) may weary less attentive readers. As in such works of speculative fiction, the reasons for the cult's enigmatically symbolic ritual and the scientific legerdemain may sound more appealing the more they remain vague.Ghosh appears to have difficulty controlling the plot although oddly (compared to many reviewers), I found the first hundred pages slower, until the explanations for the book's title entered. He does assume his readers to have enough medical wherewithal to keep up, and he may over-estimate this capacity, as many terms aren't defined, as scientists rattle off dialogue among themselves. This is natural if overhearing them, but as with any author taking us into new territory, how to keep a learned conversation convincing while teaching the ignorant about its intricacies is no easy feat for writers.The pace remained uneven. The final section as it alternated an appealingly off-kilter conspiracy with a disappointingly hasty summation of the reasons for key elements introduced in Antar's case early on let me down. I wanted to learn more about the Europeans charged with their share of the propagation, and Ghosh is content to suggest lines to draw rather than to connect all the dots. Still, the final scenes however rushed (the chosen heroine possessed considerable sangfroid that I found hard to believe) do pack a punch as to their eerie suggestiveness, even if the revelation appears to evade verisimilitude. Those involved appear to take it in stride, while portions conveyed to those about to find it revealed confused me. But, as you expect by nature in a ""what if?"" work, this may be a fairly bargained if open-ended exchange."

I felt as if I had to wait and wait for something interesting to happen. When something did happen, I found it to be pretty predictable. I think that some parts of this old book have been used in other films. I know I am not all the sudden good at predicting what happens in stories. I think it was just this book. I was confused in the beginning of this book because I spent most of the time trying to get all the Dashwood people straight. After I became familiar with the characters, I started working on the plot. I have to say that the plot was a bit uninteresting at times. When it was interesting, and not predictable for me, I really enjoyed it a lot. There were several surprises in the book. I enjoyed how tricky the plot was. Toward the end of the story I began wondering how the plot was going to wrap itself up. The ending of the book was quite unexpected for me.One of the things that I liked best about this book was that it was so tricky. Once I thought the movie was going to end a certain way, but I was immediately proven wrong. I think this happened at least five times. The bulk of the story may have been a little dry, but with all of the twists in the plot of Sense and Sensibility, I have to say I was entertained. One of the lower parts of this book would have to be the ending. It seemed as if in the space of about three minutes everyone went from melancholy, to perfectly content with their lives.Overall, I have to say that I enjoyed this book. Most Austen fans do not praise this as her best book. Most of them overlook disliking the book because it was Austen's first book. I cant be to sure because I have never read any other Austen books. However, after reading Sense and Sensibility, I am definitely going to dig in to another Austen book really soon."

Like the rest of the tale, the Council could have been dispensed with quickly and with relevance. Instead, we get numerous paragraphs on the lineage of everyone present, as well as those who are to be discussed. It is a terrible reading experience.Interestingly, after the Coucil, Tolkien's characters adopt an Olde English manner of speech, which only adds more weight to an already suffocatingly heavy load.Is Tolkien clever? Yes. Is he creative? Absolutely. Is Middle Earth a wonderfully imaginative effort? Quite.

Klinger's notes are extremely helpful and informative (not to mention entertaining), and the copious illustrations by Paget are a great addition as well. This (and the other volumes, of which Adventures, Hound of the Baskervilles, and Study in Scarlet have been published to date) are a worthy successor to William Baring-Gould's justly acclaimed annotated Holmes from years back, and are, in opinion, a better value and more enjoyable read than the rather dry Oxford editions.If you are new to Sherlock Holmes, this may not be the most economical way to pick up all of Conan Doyle's work.

(To really see what Ms. Quinn is capable of, try Romancing Mr. Bridgerton.)I'm afraid Ms. Quinn just used the Romance writer's checklist for this one: Unattainable hero? Check. Bluestocking heroine adoring from afar? Check. Late-night drunken passion in the study? Check. More passion in the huting cabin during a rainstorm? Check. A near-death that makes the hero come to his sense? Check.

Charles II is one of my favourite real people in history and this book creates him as a real breathing person. The events of this book were true and most of the story is the one that Charles himself told on the boat as he returned to England as king, 9 years after the event of the book and Samuel Pepys recorded. Because the tale is Charles own story the detail that Georgette Heyer puts in the book are often the king's own memories and the lightheartedness of the character relects his own descriptions of his actions.Charles certainly was an unusual man for his time and the story of his escape may be one of the explanations of why he was a man who wore his kingship very lightly yet valued it above all. It was hard won.True there is no suspense, anyone who reads history knows Charles did escape but if it were not a true tale it would be one which was described as an historical romp.The book does lack the romance of other books but the fact that Georgette Heyer found enough drama in the tale without rewriting recorded history adds to the bookHe was also the protype for the lovable rakes and rogues that Georgette Heyer often made her heros."

B000H7GW2Q,Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed,,A32AWPPM2P90X4,Smite5555,2/2,5.0,1330300800,Arcane Pride and Magical Prejudice,"Author Susanna Clarke lists among her influences both J. R. R. Tolkein, and Jane Austen. Both these inspirations show strongly in ""Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell."" This book, set in an alternate-historical England during the Napoleonic wars chronicles the restoration of English Magic through the efforts of two magicians (the titular Messrs Strange and Norrell). Conflict builds between the magicians, and an immortal, amoral third party threatens the life and sanity of all.Written in a style adapted from Austen's classics (known as 'Free indirect speech' to the English students), ""Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell"" is enthralling primarily because of the brilliant imagination of setting and characters. A continuous witty sense of humor combines with rich and believable (if fantastic) back story to create the feeling of something actually written in the nineteenth century. One entertaining extra is the wealth of footnotes explaining events both historical and fictional.One word of caution: This book has been presented as an action story like ""The Lord of the Rings"" or Harry Potter. This is not the case. ""Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell"" is more ""Downton Abbey"" than ""24"". While absorbing and even exciting, this book is not thrill-a-minute.I recommend this book to all readers, but especially to the Ladies and Gentlemen with the patience to appreciate its depth and wit.If you can quote along with ""The Princess Bride"", or spend six hours with Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth with A&E;'s ""Pride and Prejudice"", this book is for you.Five out of five stars."

Austen has an uncanny ability to create characters who are so petty and unlikable that one simply wants to put the book down, for lack of someone with sense. This problem, for me, brings Northanger Abbey to its knees, and weighs down Persuasion for the first seventy pages. It's a while before we get to be inside Anne Elliot's head, and in the meantime we must satisfy ourselves with her imbecilic, preening father and his protegee daughter, Elizabeth. But finally, we get to Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth, to marriage intrigue and the questioning of glances and motives--all of the things for which one absolutely loves Austen. This book provides the goods, so don't give up on it too early.Persuasion is it's own creature, however. I was immediately struck by the difference in style from her earlier book Pride and Prejudice; in Persuasion, Austen strings together dependent clauses as though the story desperately required the reader to be in suspense as to what verb she will next employ. Take, for instance, the reader's first impression of Bath:""They were come too late in the year for any amusement or variety which Lyme, as a public place, might offer; the rooms were shut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family but of the residents left; and, as there is nothing to admire in the buildings themselves, the remarkable situation of the town, the principal street almost hurrying into the water, the walk to the Cobb, skirting round the pleasant little bay, which, in the season, is animated with bathing machines and company; the Cobb itself, its old wonders and new improvements, with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town, are what the stranger's eye will seek; and a very strange stranger it must be, who does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme, to make him wish to know it better.""Some will take pleasure in reading these lines, but I personally think they do her no credit. At its best, her prose style is lucid, and suffused with that clean, English wit we expect. That being said, I find Austen more charming than aesthetically stunning, and to my tastes, her simplicity of style adds to that charm. Her convolutions detract from it.This issue was exacerbated by the decision of the editor, Gillian Beer, to not standardize punctuation. Austen has a tendency to interrupt an otherwise complete clause with a comma, which is off-putting to modern readers and detracts from her otherwise fluid style. Likewise, there has been no attempt to regulate her use of the semicolon, which 19th century authors used with abandon. Beer might argue that these editorial decisions might affect interpretation, but I never noticed a moment when emphasis might depend upon an otherwise superfluous comma. Furthermore, if there had been any instance where punctuation greatly affected meaning, I think Beer would have mentioned it in her notes--she was so very thorough. Incidentally, this lack of editorial judiciousness brings me to my final contention with the edition.While there are different opinions as to the proper domain of footnotes, I believe they exist for only a few purposes. 1.) They should explain historical and cultural references that may otherwise be outside the reader's ken. 2.) They should explain a historical use of a word that a modern reader may otherwise not know. 3.) They should give manuscript variations, when applicable. They should not (in my opinion) explain turns of phrase, or help the reader interpret the plot, or offer critiques of the novel. My reasoning is that these three tasks belong to the reader; for an editor to do all the heavy lifting actually detracts from the pleasure of reading the book. For instance, when Mr. Elliot implies that he would like to marry Anne, he says,""The name of Anne Elliot,"" said he, ""has long had an interesting sound to me. Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy; and, if I dared, I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change.""To this excellent, shining line of dialogue, Beer graciously provides a footnote: ""An oblique proposal: her name and his are the same, Elliot."" This is completely unnecessary, and for me mars the beauty of the original sentence. Also, it is inconceivable that the reader might not yet know that both Anne and Mr. Elliot share the same last name, as this exchange occurs late in the book. Unfortunately, this is not the only stupid footnote in the Penguin edition. For the sake of space, I will refrain from listing any others.On the whole, this is a fine novel; not as accomplished as some of Austen's other work, but very engaging and fun to read. She seems to be a bit more moralistic as here well, which is not to my taste, but may be to others. Oh that Mr. Elliot and his ""Sunday travelling""--ought he not to be in church? My only complaint with the novel itself (other than the occasional tortuous/torturous sentence) is the speedy resolution, which I felt could have benefited from a couple more scenes concerning the novel's two main antagonists--a confrontation would have been nice here. Also, I felt Austen took the easy way out by not forcing Anne to make a choice between two eligible suitors. Otherwise, if you like Austen, this is probably exactly what you're looking for."

Yet that is exactly what this so-called dictionary attempts to do; promote ignorance and slanderous lies (when it's not simply providing partial truths).The authors clearly did NOT research the occult or much about the other religious groups they write about. Not only do they repeatedly credit Satanism for beliefs completely unrelated to that Sect, but they mutilate any respectable definition of the peace sign -- calling it the ""Satanists Pentacle"" (when penta is the prefix meaning ""five"" and there are no five points inside a peace sign).Regarding the Wiccan Rede -- the authors erroneously attribute it to Aleister Crowley who had NOTHING to do with either Wicca or with the Rede, as an ethical principle that's regularly drummed around many neo-pagan circles. Many would argue Crowley had nothing to do with ethics at all. In fact, he purported ""Do what thou wilt shall be the whole law"" (feel like having sex with your neighbor's infant? Do it!) while the Wiccan Rede states ""An it harm none, do what ye will."" The authors also falsely claim that Satanists follow the Rede, when they are not at all compelled by Wiccan dogma, but (according to the Satanist Bible) follow their own rules to do whatever's the OPPOSITE of Christianity.The two examples, provided above, are but the tip of the iceberg for how inaccurate is this dictionary.

I remember the experience as painful and ardous. But after reading A Tale of Two Cities, I realize that my opinion must have been influenced by excessive pouting. There is simply no way that a man who could write something one the level of A Tale of Two Cities could write something tedious. When people say that everything important can be found in this novel, they are not exagerrating. Love, tyranny, triumph over oppresion, the futility of the mob, and, most importantly, self-sacrafice. This is one of the greatest novels ever written, I don't hesitate to say so. Dickens has a singular ability to present an enveloping view of all humanity, all it's triumphs, struggles, and failings, and yet he can still produce characters who don't get lost in the sweep of the plot. In addition to this, Dickens (along with many others, such as Hugo, Dostoeysky, and Tolstoy) marks the transition from the &quot;listing&quot; style of writing (simple list of events written down) to the truly artistic novel. You'll find yourself rolling his words over your tounge, in awe of their brilliance. For your own sake, read it, read it again, and never forget it."
9993552011,The Nine Tailors,,A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ,Michael K. Smith,3/3,5.0,1296864000,One of Sayers's two or three best!,"To the geeks among her readership, this is one of Sayers's most thoroughly fascinating novels featuring Lord Peter Wimsey. Peter and Bunter are driving through the Norfolk fens late one blizzardy New Year's Eve when the car goes into a ditch and they have to hike through the blowing snow to the nearest village of Fenchurch St. Paul. They're taken in by the elderly rector and his wife, who assure them the car can be rescued in the morning -- but just now, the rector is planning a big event in the huge 11th century parish church across the road. Mr. Venables is an avid bell-ringer with a crack team of rope-pullers from the village under him and they're about to attempt a full peal of Kent Treble Bob Major -- 15,840 rings, taking more than nine hours. ""Ringing the changes"" means following mathematical progression, not playing tunes. It's a peculiarly English avocation and has been for a long time; Batty Thomas, the oldest bell of the eight in the belfry of St. Paul's, was cast in 1368 and the local records of progressive ringing go back more than two hundred years. It's also an arcane subject with its own jargon: ""`Make it a 704,' said the Rector. `Call her in the middle with a double, before, wrong, and home, and repeat.'"" And Sayers doesn't bother to explain any of this, which keeps it all mysterious and rather bewildering. (One could wishe she had included an explanatory appendix.) Anyway, one of the ringers is suddenly taken by influenza and Wimsey, an old bell-ringer himself, naturally, is dragooned into substituting -- which he carries off successfully, to everyone's grateful delight. And then the car is fixed and Wimsey and Bunter proceed on their way. Meanwhile, the local squire dies and preparations are made to bury him in the same grave with his wife, who had passed away only a few months before. But in opening the grave, another body is discovered just below the surface, an unknown intruder with a battered face and lacking its hands (and its fingerprints). The local cops are having no luck with the case so the rector writes a hopeful note to Wimsey in London: Might he have some suggestions as to how to proceed? Hah! A mystery, and under highly unusual circumstances! Peter's down there like a shot! And then things begin to get complicated. There was this theft of a very valuable emerald necklace back in 1914, and various people died or went to prison, but the emeralds were never recovered. And as Lord Peter's investigation widens, it becomes clear that the two cases are intertwined. The suspects pile up but they all seem to have alibis -- and besides, Wimsey discovers that the people he personally likes appear to be the best suspects, which doesn't make him happy. It's a complex plot, with some notable characters among both the cops and the fen people, as well as the absent-minded rector himself. And the water-logged fens are a major player, too. This is widely considered one of Sayers's very best efforts and I have to say I agree."

This book by David Wilkerson takes no prisoners -- and that includes heresy hunters and ""lukewarm"" churchgoers (notice I didn't mention Christians). I believe one must be spirit-filled to fully agree with this book. The mood echoes that of a 20th century Jeremiah or Ezekiel -- and the finger of woe is pointed directly at America.I, for one, believe that America is in great danger. I do not claim to be a doomsday prophet; I take notice of the signs of the time. Yes, you don't have to be a spiritual giant to see that TV is immersed in total trash. The author wrote this book back in 1985, and television was bad enough then. Now, just about everything on the screen is coated with sensual sinfulness and dipped in blasphemy and arrogance. And TV has become an undeniable idol for this nation. Nothing at all glorifies God on the big screen (or the ""Babylonian idiot box"", as the author writes).Popular music and its artists bow down to the whims of society rather than to the Living God. I challenge anyone to dispute the fact that both music and television have slipped even further away from God since the 80's. Things have gotten worse dramatically since Elvis' 1950-ish gyrations -- now the hip-hop artists glamorize cop shootings and drunken orgies. Rock stars perform their shows under the influence of narcotics and intoxicants. The cross meanwhile is tattoed on their arms and worn around their necks. I've recently been to a so-called Christian concert and heard some of the bands that stood for Jesus. Personally, I couldn't tell the difference between Slayer and Pillar. It was all head-banging and moshing. The lead singer grunted and growled and wore ripped-up, grungy jeans. His body was covered with tattoos. If Jesus Christ was being glorified during the all the moshing and stage diving, I must have missed it.I say David Wilkerson is right on the money when he prophesies God will judge this nation for such foolishness and rebellion -- and most of all, for making a mockery of His name. Remember, God will not be mocked. Hosea 4:6 says that God's people will be destroyed for lack of knowledge. Very often I see some supposed ""born-again"" Christian artist get on television and sing for Jesus in a video. But I notice the cherry-red lipstick and seductive eye liner and I see her strike lewd glances at the camera and blow kisses, and I say ""Wait a minute! Isn't this supposed supposed to be all about Jesus? Why then do I need to see all the close-ups on her pretty face and slender physique?"" That, to me, is a stumbling block for young men. All I see is cleavage, muscles and hair gel. Just insert ""God"" in the lyrics or a ""thank-you, Jesus"" and the artist becomes an instant Christian role model for some kid.And as for Russia destroying America...it's not too late. It's never too late for stuff like that to happen. Cold War, Shmold War. All the reviewers here who automatically labeled the author of this book a false prophet when the USSR became the Russian Federation ought not to jump the gun. Ever heard of Gog and Magog? Read the book of Daniel. Remember, nobody knows the day or hour. It could happen tomorrow, or in another 500 years.All in all, Set the Trumpet to Thy Mouth is an unpopular warning to all America, a warning of God's condemnation and subsequent punishment for all her harlotries. Like Sodom and Gomorrah, God will obliterate our society (in one hour) by virtue of a Russian nuclear assault (hydrogen holocaust).Take it or leave it. I choose to take it, and cling to holiness. However it happens, we know this world will pass away according to Revelation, and tribulation is unavoidable. If you're washed in the blood of Jesus Christ none of it should matter anyhow. Books like this one, after all, are geared towards the unrepentant sinner and unsaved."

The title may form preconceptions, but this isn't Mills &amp; Boon romance, or even a love story in the accepted sense. The reality of the horrors of war, particularly trenchlife in the 1st World War are vividly brought to life--the story relolves around the grim sentence of 5 soldiers caught for desertion and thrown into No Mans Land between the French &amp; German Lines at the Front Line of the Somme; and Mathilde Donnay, a cripple from childhood who is afianced to one of those soldiers. Her courage and fortitude to discover what happened to her fiance isn't super hero(ine) stuff, but her character grabs you so much, that you, the reader, can't bear not to find out too. Linda Coverdale has done a superb translation, although this book was a best seller and prize winner in France there was no guarantee that much of the essence would be lost (as happens with so many translations fronm one language to another), but she has done full justice to the original work.

077832267X,Mackenzies' Honor: Mackenzie's Pleasure\A Game Of Chance (Mira Romance),,A21MY0W0L1O1BU,bookjunkiereviews,27/36,3.0,1137888000,Worth buying for Mackenzie's Pleasure,"In December 2005, I stumbled across this book (MACKENZIE'S PLEASURE) in a Silhouette edition twofer combining books by two different authors. Mackenzie's Pleasure, my Buried Treasure find for 2005, is the story of Zane Mackenzie, the youngest son of Wolf Mackenzie and his wife Mary Elizabeth (hero and heroine of Mackenzie's Mountain); I would love to see a twofer combining Mackenzie's Mountain with Mackenzie's Pleasure. Unfortunately, I have to settle for this book, which combines an excellent book with a less successful one.Zane Mackenzie is called upon to execute a mission to rescue an ambassador's kidnapped daughter Barrie Lovejoy out of Libya. The first third of the book is about how the rescue takes place and with what consequences. In the second third, Zane and Barrie are separated by circumstances until they manage to find each other. Since there is a mystery and a bit of romantic suspense to the plot, I will not go further with the plot summary. It is probably sufficient to say that Barrie's kidnapping and rescue is somewhat more complicated than either Zane or Barrie realized.MACKENZIE'S PLEASURE is one of the few stories where I genuinely liked the hero and heroine from the outset, and where I also felt that they were right for each other. That this contributed to my liking the book is not in question. Linda Howard's writing style also helped, as did her characterizations. Zane is an alpha male but not an overbearing alpha, but a protector and leader. The other SEALS came alive as did the heroine and her Ambassador father. What didn't work so well for me was the villain and his motivation (especially as explained to Barrie at the end).Unfortunately, A GAME OF CHANCE is a very different kind of story about Chance, the adoptive son. Putting Chance and Zane together in the same ""twofer"" makes some sense, given that they are about the same age and apparently fought together regularly. The problem is not that Chance is the adoptive son, but that he is a different person from Zane. Whereas Zane makes it a point to protect the woman he loves (whether he realizes it or not), Chance uses the woman he loves (the heroine) as a bait for a dangerous trap. Arguing that he is not in love with the heroine does not change this fact. Chance's story is thus a disappointment for those who love heroes in the mold of Wolf and Zane Mackenzie, men who would do almost anything (save betray their country) to protect their families and their mates. I keep wondering if Chance would again put his wife in the line of fire in the national interest; the trouble is that I cannot convince myself that he had changed by the end.MIRA's reprints: Mackenzie's Mountain (Wolf) goes with Mackenzie's Mission (Joe) in one volume. While Mackenzie's Magic (a story in an anthology) is left out, Mackenzie's Pleasure (Zane) is combined with A Game of Chance (Chance) in another volume. Of course, we have no stories for Michael and Josh, but have to find out what happy ending was in store for them from the first and last chapter of Mackenzie's Pleasure.

Written in the style of an extended &quot;People Magazine&quot; article, it would have been better titled simply &quot;Bob abd Louis.&quot;It's reasonably well written, albeit in a breezy style, but you'll learn nothing more about Bob Hanssen, his character, or his motivations than you already know if you followed the news coverage of his arrest and conviction. You'll know more about Louis Freeh than you did before but most of it is &quot;file and forget&quot; trivia.The author started out I think to write a definitive account of Hanssen's extended espionage but soon found out he didn't have enough material for a full book so he went to his word processor, dragged up his notes for a book about Freeh (a project which I suspect he had abandoned when Freeh's career went in the tank), and merged then together into a one book.I felt I wasted my money buying it and, more importantly, my time reading it."

0829421157,Heroic Leadership: Best Practices from a 450-Year-Old Company That Changed the World,11.53,A23E2117PNU52H,"B. K. Rice ""LCI Book Reviews""",3/3,5.0,1250208000,Jesuits and Ignatius on an Ancient-Future Kind of Leader,"First I'll let you know I am a raving fan of this book.Second, I am enormously influenced by the Jesuit approach to spiritual formation.Third, my profession has to do with leadership development.Finally, I am always looking for how to improve the process, the delivery system, the content, the relational engagements and the outcomes when I design leadership training environments.Oh, by the way, I am not a Jesuit and I am not Roman Catholic. I am an evangelical Protestant who is deeply appreciative of a variety of religious traditions and grateful for help I can find in different traditions.The book, Heroic Leadership: Best Practices From a 450 Year Old Company That Changed the World, by Chris Lowney (a former Jesuit) is rich in ideas, insights, illustrations and a ""system"" that was designed by Ignatius of Loyola in the mid-1500's.In a nutshell, Lowney organizes the Jesuit genius around four organizing pillars that are not individual pillars, but which weave together in a synergistic whole where the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts.Here are the four pillars: (1) Self-Awareness and the reordering of one's inner world, (2) Ingenuity and the ability to radically innovate in a changing world, (3) Love as essential to a worldview that generates the resonance of emotional intelligence, (4) Heroism and having great desires, great resolves. Put these together and you have a process for helping people run full speed into perfection. The Jesuits went way beyond good, they stopped briefly at great and then soared on to atmospheric heights above that. They were truly one of the greatest missional organizations ever created.Lowney explains each of these pillars clearly. He provides historical examples of the Jesuits in action who illustrate these pillars. Rabbit Trail Note: I really like these historical examples for I am involved in cross cultural missional work and I love history. If neither of those are of interest to you, you can skim through those sections. Not that I would advise doing that... but you can. Second Rabbit Trail Note: If you ever saw the movie The Mission with Robert De Niro and Jeremy Irons, read chapter 8 to get some of the historical and political background and then watch the movie again.Lowney also pulls into his book, themes from the Spiritual Exercises. For someone who is not familiar with the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius, you won't fully benefit from his allusions to them. I have gone through the Exercises and am currently going through them again. Lowney gave me some new windows to appreciate the greatness of the Exercises and actually expanded my vision on their usefulness. I now see them, not just as spiritually formative exercises, but as leadership forming exercises.For me, the desired outcome of reading a book is that I come away with ideas for change, motivation to do so and a few practical ideas for how to run full speed toward perfection. Chris Lowney has provided all of that and more.Brian RiceLeadership ConneXtions International[...]"

B00088ZN1A,"I, Claudius (Armed Services edition)",,AT2R7ZVT7QYOU,Daniel Myers,15/17,3.0,1208995200,Mad But Interesting,"There's not much I can say here or desire to say here that hasn't been covered by the other reviewers. Just to reiterate though: The character of Livia, as presented here in Graves's novel, is NOT based on any sound scholarship, new or otherwise. It's true that she COULD have poisoned her way to power as depicted here. But bear in mind that Claudius himself COULD have just as well done so himself, with this first person narration serving as a cover up. - Be it remembered that Claudius (the actual emperor) did write an actual first person Autobiography, now lost to us. - Who knows what ulterior motives he might have harboured in doing so? In any event, altogether too many untimely deaths of all sorts pile up to attribute to any one person. It also seems clear to me that Graves, in describing the Germans, was certainly drawing a parallel to the Germans he fought against in WWI.But, laying historical accuracy to one side, this is a clever and interesting read. It is not, to my mind, the masterpiece some reviewers here make it out to be. But I enjoyed it. The impression one has on closing the book and reflecting on the murders, mayhem and madness that occur on almost every page leaves one feeling about the book as Claudius felt about the last, ebrious conversation he had with Livia:""The conversation was like the sort one has in dreams - mad but interesting."""

0525937048,Free Enterprise: A Novel,,A2VKWLCNZF4ZVB,The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers,3/3,4.0,1103673600,No Regrets,"Most of us have heard of John Brown and his unsuccessful raid on Harpers Ferry. But how many of us have heard of Mary Ellen Pleasant? Mary Ellen Pleasant was a civil rights leader before there was an official movement, yet she is often omitted from history books. In FREE ENTERPRISE Michelle Cliff uses a mixture of historical fact and fiction to create a complex tale that highlights the life of this often overlooked phenomenal woman.The book takes place in the mid 1800's and focuses on the lives of Mary Ellen Pleasant, a wealthy hotelier from California, and Annie Christmas, a young Jamaican who left her home to make a life in the United States. In addition, special attention is paid to the relationship the two women shared and their involvement in the abolitionist movement. The story is not told in a linear fashion; instead the author takes readers back and forth in time. In addition, the story is told from through the voices of several different characters in a series of vignettes. The result is a complex and richly detailed story told with a strong literary flair.I thoroughly enjoyed FREE ENTERPRISE; it is a thought-provoking and enjoyable tale. It is a weighty read, and requires full attention and thought. As Michelle Cliff alternates from time to time, place to place, and voice to voice, she provides intricate details that when woven together result in a powerful tale. I particularly loved the fact that all of the major characters in the book were women, and that the author depicted them as strong, intelligent and well-rounded, especially considering the time period in which the story took place. FREE ENTERPRISE is a well-written, literary read with strong female characters, and a pleasant mixture of history and creativity. This is the kind of book you could read several times and each time take something new away; definitely a story to savor.Reviewed by Stacey Seayof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"

B000EU3VXO,"Black Boy (Signet, T2341)",,,,2/3,5.0,896918400,Black Boy is the BOMB!!,Black Boy is a wonderful book that everyone should read. I LOVED IT and it made a clearer understanding of how ghetto life can sometimes be. I think that Richard is a strong boy with a wild imagination and he can put up with the challenges that life puts in his face. His father leaves his family to go with another woman and Richard and his mother and brother stay alone. His mother works and just can't support them. The story goes on with a variety of experiences and challenges that Richard faces. He ends up being a man and I know that deep down in his heart he has a feeling of hate toward the people that discriminated against him and didn't treat him like a human being. Well I think that you should read this book in order to get a better understanding of what I am trying to say. I know that you will end up loving this book.
B00088AOXC,"Herodotus, (Bohn's classical library)",,A1ST408CHP050B,Eustathios,0/0,5.0,1359936000,Michael A. Flower's and John Marincola's commentary on Herodotus Book IX,"This is a review of Michael A. Flower's and John Marincola's commentary on Book IX of Herodotus's Histories for the Cambridge green and yellow series. Book IX is the final book of Herodotus's Histories and contains, among other things, Herodotus's accounts of the Battles of Plataea and Mycale, the immediate aftermath of the Persians' defeat in and withdrawal from mainland Greece, and the Siege of Sestos. F&M; are particularly interested in showing how Book IX achieves closure for the Histories as a whole and how it prefigures the political-cultural landscape of the mid-late fifth century BC, when Herodotus was writing, so a reader interested in Herodotus's aspirations/agenda as a historian and author and how Herodotus's narrative anticipates later (particularly Athenian) historical developments will find this commentary particularly enlightening.This edition consists of a 50 page introduction, 50 pages of Greek text, about 215 pages of commentary, four brief appendices occupying 11 pages, a very comprehensive bibliography of almost 20 pages (current through 2002), and two indexes (one for Greek terms, and one for general topics). The authors provide enough grammatical and lexical help that a student in his or her third or fourth year of studying Greek should be able to read Book IX with little difficulty using the commentary, and the majority of the notes in fact are primarily designed to help with translation. However, the discussions of literary and historical issues are fairly complex and clearly pitched to an advanced audience, so this edition is probably not suitable for a student reading Greek prose for the first time (Amy Barbour's textbook ""Selections from Herodotus"" is a better option in this respect). Unlike many modern commentaries on the works of ancient historians, the treatment of historiographic problems is balanced quite well with discussions of the literary qualities of Herodotus's text. Delineating Herodotus's appropriation of Homeric language and ideology, for example, is accorded just as much importance as evaluating the historical accuracy of Herodotus's narrative. Readers who are interested in Herodotus from either a literary critical angle or from a historical angle will therefore both find useful material in this commentary.There are number of other features of this edition that are worthy of note. The introduction - in addition to containing the usual accounts of Herodotus's life and times, an overview of his style and techniques as an author/historian, a very brief reckoning of the manuscripts, and an analysis of the major themes, characters, and events of Book IX - also includes a concise guide to Herodotus's Ionic dialect, giving readers who are only familiar with Attic prose a handy aid for identifying and understanding Ionic forms. The four appendices provide Greek texts of and commentary on primary sources that complement the narrative of Book IX (i.e. Simonides' poem on Plataea, the putative dedication of the seer Teisamenus, and the so-called 'Oath of Plataea') as well as a list of the troops composing the Greek and Persian battle lines at Plataea.It is not possible in a short review to enumerate all the different questions and issues F&M; cover in their notes, but I will say that their commentary is one of the most wide-ranging, erudite, and thought-provoking that I have encountered in this or any other series of commentaries on ancient texts. It is one of the few commentaries on the market that attempts to address ALL aspects of a text in detail while still prioritizing providing grammatical help to the student-reader, and on the whole it succeeds remarkably well in doing so. Moreover, the commentary is composed in a very straight-forward and engaging style and is often quite entertaining. For example, as part of a note on Herodotus's account of the seer Hegesistratus, who had to escape a Spartan prison by mutilating his foot so that he could wrest it free from the chain that bound it, F&M; remark (pg.177) with perfect aplomb: ""Two physicians have confirmed for us that Hegesistratus could have survived and not bled to death before reaching Tegea"".In short, then, this commentary combines magisterial learning with judicious organization and presentation, and should definitely be read by anyone with a few years of Greek and a serious interest in Herodotus and Greek History."
B000KD7GKE,HYPERION,,A1S07WMPAZURTE,ira heitner,2/2,5.0,961632000,hyperion,"After reading a short story by Dan Simmons, which takes place after the Hyperion series, I had to get his first one Hyperion. The book has everything a reader of science fiction wants. The characters are interesting, each one telling a different tale as to why they are traveling to Hyperion. The backdrop of intergalactic war keeps everything exciting. The story is very complex so pay attention. This is not a book you can put down and get back to later. You won't want too though. Trying to sum up this book in a short review is hard, there is so much going on at once. The main story is about seven people making a pilgrimage to the planet Hyperion. A creature called the shrike awaits them. They must each ask the shrike for something, all will die but one. The existence of mankind is thought to hinge on the one who survives and his request. It may sound like fantasy, but this is hardcore science fiction. All the gadgets, spacecraft, weapons, and badguys are here. Some of the concepts and landscapes are incredible. Readers who like the artificial intelligence theories will love this as they play a central part in the story. Once you read this book, the others in the series will naturaly follow. If they could only make a movie out of this."

B00073AJ2E,Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book),,A3FZAMTFHORTJN,"Akamai Wahine ""Erykah""",1/1,4.0,1195430400,Great book for 5th grade Social Studies Unit,"As a homeschool teacher I found Johnny Tremain a wonderful aid in helping my students learn about the events that led to the Revolutionary War. Set in the growing city of Boston, Johnny Tremain is a young teenage boy learning about the trials and tribulations of being a silversmith's apprentice. Johnny learns a hard lesson when he rushes to finish a silver pitcher and burns his hand terribly. Unable to continue his apprenticeship, Johnny is forced with a life changing decision, what shall his trade be now that he has this disfigured hand?The book gets exciting at this point and Johnny meets Mr Lorne and his nephew Rab. They run a printing shop called the Boston Observer. They take Johnny in and give him a job riding a skittish horse named Goblin. Johnny's new job requires he learn to control his horse Goblin and deliver the Boston Observer to men on the outside of town. Johnny quickly becomes informed about the currents events transpiring in Boston. He attentively listens to the leaders of opposition and becomes an ardent Whig. Very much interested in Politics and wanting to make a difference, Johnny shares that he will do whatever it takes to help his fellow Wig. Johnny becomes a strong force in the Boston Tea Party, gathering young boys and men to dress up as Natives and dump the english tea into the Boston Harbor. These events anger the British terribly and they want the colonists to pay for the destroyed tea. The rest of the book describes the Boston colonists fighting against Tyranny, demanding representation in the English Parliament, the famous words are written Taxation without representation is tyranny.This is a wonderful book to share with young students, they can relate to the character because he is a young boy that is driven to make something of his life. In addition the students can get a taste of the importance of standing up against tyranny at all costs. Johnny is truly a remarkable boy and participates in the changing of American History.I highly recommend this book to any teacher who is interested in integrating Social Studies topics with English and Writing activities. Our school used this book to write a paper about the events that lead to the Revolutionary War and how Johnny Tremain helped his fellow colonists overcome the Tyranny of the British."
B000J316NS,The Stand. The Complete and Uncut Edition,,A1MC6BFHWY6WC3,D. Blankenship,0/2,5.0,1090800000,WORTH A SECOND READ,"This was a reread for me. I originally read the book when first published, enjoyed it then and have enjoyed it now after well over 12 years. This of course was the &quot;expanded version&quot; and I am glad King decided to do this. I like the character developement, the twists of the plot and King's ability to show the good and bad which is found in all of us. While the novel is indeed quite lenghty, it reads well and does not take all that long to finish. While this, by the author's own admission, is not his favorite novel, I certainly feel it is my favorite, by this author. The movies certainly did not do it justice. All in all, recommend it..it is well worth a first or second reading."

However, this book should not be attempted by a weekend reader. While the series is good, the first book moves slowly, and I feel that unless you read books quick you will get disenhartened and bored before long - but if you do make it to the end, one of the best endings of all books awaits. Its other strengths are a believable fantasy world - a human world, with almost no magic, monsters or other races, meaning that the world is understandable and easier to emerse oneself in - like Eddings, without gods. Note that the word is almost - minute amounts of magic, monsters and elf-equivalents appear in mostly supporting roles."
B000NOPQKW,OUT OF THE SILENT PLANET - The Perelandra Trilogy Book (1) One,,A3V617IJGAZX20,"G. Santos ""Caritas-et-Veritas""",0/0,5.0,1353110400,A great sci-fi exercise in moral imagination,"First of all, this is a classic work from the author of Chronicles of Narnia and a bunch of other books which should be part of any well educated person's repertoire (Abolition of Man, Screwtape Letters, etc.). This means the prospective reader, who is deciding whether or not to buy and read the book, may rest assured that he will not be exposed to some upgraded fun fiction with cardboard characters and a contrived plot. This is a real novel.For those who are wondering whether Lewis is as good in sci-fi as in fantasy, I believe he does pull it off quite nicely. He doesn't have the same imaginative freedom as in the Narnia series (after all, the planets featured in the trilogy actually exist and orbit the Sun, so there must be some concern with laws of physics, astronomy, and such), but he manages quite well to incorporate humanist and spiritual themes through the use of fantastic characters in a ""scientific"" setting.Above all, Lewis provides us with an artistic experience of the moral imagination, in which we witness the moral dilemmas facing mankind and their concrete implications, enacted through the characters and choices of the story's personae dramatis. There are embodied (perhaps with a little too much caricature, which at least highlights these moral choices) the unhampered will to power (disguised as abstract love of humanity), the sheer and vulgar materialistic hedonism and greed, as well as the commonsensical moral uprightness allied to a curiosity about what real people (human, hross, sorn or pfifltriggi) hold inside and express through linguistic and cultural habits.The story does not offer unbearable heights of suspense, or intricate plot twists. Instead, it is a development or clarification of these characters, or moral choices, powered by a basic conflict that creates the tension for the novel: one of the human characters has been kidnapped by the other two, who intend to offer him up as a sacrifice as a trade-in for whatever they hope to accomplish on planet Malacandra. The final denouement and clarification is made possible by the inclusion of a clever literary device in the shape of a set of powerful characters who hold the key to the general distinctions between the earthly and the aliens.These characters (the eldil) are by no means of the ""Deus ex machina"" kind, but are a central piece of the book's fictional universe, and an important part of the answer to the question--to which the book purports to provide a reply--about the implications of the Christian theodicy and specifically the account of the Fall to the rest of the universe and its possible inhabitants. Spiritual and physical are brought close together in this very imaginative solution, in which we see that outer ""space"" can be, with the right moral and imaginative attitude, more properly called ""heaven"".The book leaves us with the suggestion that the very fabric of the universe may be filled with ethical substance, and that to see humanity in an evolutionary struggle for the survival of the fittest is, rather than a scientific conclusion, in fact a moral choice."

It is very clear and well-written, assumes only what you can find in an introduction to topology like Hatcher's, and gives an intuitive explanation of many important results which are a prerequisite for working in low-dimensional topology, although, since it is just an intro, it does not include full proofs. I would recommend this book for someone curious to learn some basic facts, and it's a fantastic way for a new topologist to get introduced to the field. For example, it includes a useful section on Kirby calculus which eases the jump to in-depth works like Gompf and Stipsicz."

And almost every modern fantasy writer draws on LOTR alot. But they have the advantage of doing it more...subtley.But even that might have been excusable if it had been a bit more interesting with a slight hint of unique style. I also agree with everyone else in that it was predicdtable. But the thing that really annoyed me? The fact that Eragon did not seem real. Even Brom seemed more realistic than the main character. And the way that Paolini kept on dropping BIG hints that Eragon was going to have this romantic love affair. That has really put me off the next book. And I wonder who the lover is going to be? A beautiful elf. My advice is to read Terry Prattchet instead who at least uses characters who seem stereo-typical but really are as unpredictable as you can get."

Temple,0/0,4.0,952300800,The Politics of the Future,"In this book, Michelle Mitchell clears up one of the biggest misconceptions about the 18-35 year old crowd. Too often they are written off as self-indulgent, tuned out brats. Mitchell makes the compelling case that what is often perceived as cynicism is really just healthy skepticism.After all, this is a generation that has been marketed to and spun for their entire lives. No wonder they want to know the facts and judge for themselves.She also makes a stong case that what this generation needs more than anything else from their political leaders is authenticity. They want someone who will tell them the truth, even if it is unpleasant and then lay out a compelling vision as to how to approach the problem, an approach that includes a role for them. Until such a person comes along, this generation will be perfectly content to satisfy their political urges in local direct action and forego much activity on the national political scene.If what you do isn't going to make a difference, then why bother playing that game? Why not play a game that show immediate results, seems to be the attitude.All in all, this is an enjoyable read that is filled with insight for anyone who hopes to reach this increasingly important demographic block of voters."

0312336985,The Gap-Year Advantage: Helping Your Child Benefit from Time Off Before or During College,13.86,AUJ4K5TKWZW9Z,Thomas Moore,28/29,5.0,1134518400,Take Advantage of 'The Gap Year Advantage',"'The Gap-Year Advantage: Helping your Child Benefit from Time Off Before or During College,' by Karl Haigler and Rae Nelson, is one of those unconventional offerings in the social-educational sphere that has the potential to ignite a mini-revolution and transform our society by changing the lives of individual young people in profound ways.Today we never stop telling our kids how intelligent they are, how lucky they are to live in such a mobile, technologically advanced, and affluent society. Yet for all its abundance and limitless choices, today's world poses extraordinary challenges to our children. The ancient verities and old certainties are gone, leaving many kids confused, aimless, even self-destructive. The family, cultural, and societal norms that once helped them mature into functional adults have changed radically. We expect our children to go through twelve intensive years of primary and secondary school and then head off to college, now an absolute prerequisite for middle-class status and economic security.Yet think for a moment what those twelve years do to our children. With few exceptions, the U.S. school system is based on the Prussian model imported by Horace Mann and Thomas Dewey in the late 19th Century, a system designed to mold obedient soldiers and acquiescent factory workers in the service of the Prussian state. Kids must endure a rigidly prescribed curriculum ladled out to them in regular fifty-minute intervals, during which they must sit obediently and receive spoon-fed knowledge passively, interrupted only by rigidly prescribed exams. The result in government schools, in particular, is often a loss of creativity, spontaneity, independent thinking, self-knowledge, and maturity, even if kids do manage to imbibe a degree of academic knowledge.Enter the ""gap year."" This is the simple yet revolutionary idea that students should take a year off between high school and college, or during college, for a period of self-examination and self-discovery. The modality of that inner journey can be any number of things --- foreign travel, volunteer or community service work, or learning a new skill. The authors tell a vivid story of their son who embarked on a wonderful array of adventures before entering college to his great benefit, thus they write from practical experience as well as from an impressive knowledge base.Though I never thought I'd face these same issues, I can attest to the wisdom of the gap year. My own son experienced burnout three-fourths of his way through college. Using the Haigler-Nelson book, we put together a gap year that involves working on a farm (and getting mentored in other ways at the same time), a six-week stint at Outward Bound's Wilderness Course, some non-traditional skills-training, and a month of independent study abroad. While my son hasn't yet finished his gap, he tells me he has more optimism about the future than he's felt in over a year.'The Gap Year Advantage' is well-named, for the gap year confers real and practical advantages. It's not just a gap-year option or a gap-year substitute for the ""real"" business of formal education. Moreover, the book is far more than a mere catalogue of volunteer, service, study, or travel opportunities. It is well-written, at times even lyrically so, the obvious product of thoughtful and philosophically sophisticated people. In sum, it is a remarkable treatise on human development and an answer for some of the most troubling issues our kids face today. I wish my son had encountered the gap-year idea three years ago. For that matter, I wish I had encountered it forty years ago."

The reason I like this plan the best is that it is based on a sound diet, eliminating bad foods or junk food and offers a detox with a combination of supplements and teas. It's a wonderful plan to do even if you are very busy. I was quite excited to blend my own herbal teas and they are fabulous and working. There is an expense involved in buying the supplements if you do not have them and the ingredients for the teas. Shop the internet for great prices and avoid the store. The only criticism I have is that the author did not recommend a parasite cleanse before the detox. She acknowledged toxins from parasites in the book and I was surprised she did not strongly recommend doing a parasite cleanse first. I started a parasite cleanse two weeks before the detox plan and carried it into the detox plan. The plan also allows you do be flexible and extend any of the phases that target specific areas. It's a great book. It's better to spend the money on preventive healthcare than medical bills!"

0375403140,Melville: His World and Work,,A21VR7M8O55EF6,Robin Friedman,40/43,5.0,1140998400,A New Study of Herman Melville,"Herman Melville (1819 -- 1893) is one of the writers I have returned to again and again over the course of years. Thus, I was gratified to receive this new book by Andrew Delbanco, ""Melville: His Life and Work"" (2005) as a gift and to have the opportunity to read it, think again about Melville, and share my thoughts on this site with other readers. Delbanco is Levi Professor in the Humanities and Director of American Studies at Columbia University. He has published widely on American literature, including a book titled ""Required Reading: why our American Classics matter now."" Before reading Professor Delbanco's Melville study, I also read the lengthy review by Frederick Crews in the December 1, 2005, ""New York Review"" which is both laudatory and critical.The literature on Melville continues to grow, and in recent years biographies have been published that are longer and far more detailed than Professor Delbanco's. But Delbanco's study is accessible, engagingly written, and concentrates, as the subtitle to his book implies, in placing Melville in the historical context of Nineteenth Century America, and on the works themselves. I will discuss each of these factors briefly.As to Nineteenth Century America, Professor Delbanco discusses Melville's roots as the descendant, on both sides of his family, of heroes of the Revolutionary War. He gives a revealing picture of pre-Bellum America and of the seafaring life. He gives a detailed historical discussion, for a literary biography, of the tumults which split the United States and lead to the Civil War, including the War with Mexico, the compromises of 1850, and the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. Professor Delbanco shows how Melville responded to both the literary and political events of his time. He also gives a good, if briefer, treatment of the Civil War and of Melville's life thereafter, as the United States expanded and a crude materialism became dominant. But most vividly, Professor Delbanco gives a picture of New York City, both before and after the Civil War, and argues convincingly for the strong formative influence that the city exerted on Melville's writings.As to Melville's writings, Professor Delbanco devotes a great deal of space to Melville's four widely-recognized masterpieces: Moby Dick, Bartelby, Benito Cereno, and Billy Budd. He offers textual exposition, compositional background, and a good literary sense of the complexities and ambiguities in each of these works. He offers shorter yet rewarding discussions of several of Melville's more controversial efforts, including Pierre, The Confidence Man, his collection of Civil War Poetry called Battle Pieces, and the long poem Clarel. I think that Delbanco undervalues some of the poetry, particularly Battle Pieces which I have found over the years a provocative literary guide to the Civil War.The treatment of Melville's life is interrelated well with a study of his works, as Professor Delbanco gives succint discussions of Melville's early years, his decision to go to sea, his marriage, the question of his sexual orientation, the friendship with Nathaniel Hawthorne, his travels and wanderings, the tragic deaths of two of his sons, and the long reclusive years Melville spent as a customs inspector in New York City. We see Melville with all his difficulties and as a great but in his lifetime forgotten writer. Readers interested in a good novelistic portrayal of Melville may wish to read Frederick Busch's ""The Night Inspector"", to which Professor Delbanco refers.(...)I came away from Professor Belbanco's book with the desire to revist some of the Melville works that I have read in the past and, perhaps, to read some of the works that I don't know for the first time. I think it is the purpose of a study such as Delbanco's to return to reader to the words of the author, in this case Melville. Delbanco's book succeeds in doing so admirably.(...)"

This book is perfect for anyone going through a similar situation. Gregory Huth addresses some of the paradoxes in the bible I have always felt needed further explanation, and he does it in a manner that does not contradict or offend people of various religious backgrounds. In fact, he highly stresses the importance of looking past religion into the deeper aspects of being spiritual and I couldn't agree more. After reading the book I feel more secure in my personal spirituality and can more fully appreciate the different spiritualities of those around me. I would whole-heartedly recommend this book to anyone who considers themselves even remotely spiritual and especially to those who are searching for the answers to some of the questions that cannot be answered by simply attending church."

Also, I wish the breadth of dialogs and conversations were broader. It seems the focus of these lessons were more tailored towards a business man visiting Portugal. But I think this is a good series to begin your lessons."

The food and drink recipes at the end of most chapters make it easy to travel along with the crew of the Receta-Ann and her husband Steve-by preparing for yourself the same cuisine they enjoyed. And, it's heartwarming to see them get along for the entire two years-there's no crisis, no threats of divorce, just a happy couple taking a long break and learning to see some of the nicer things in life."
B00005BC13,The Gods of Mars,,A3VD8ORY16XNQN,"""jmbyrne25""",3/4,4.0,1003190400,Sci-Fi and Victorian prose,"ERB is a pioneer in science fiction and I can see the influence his work has had on many of my favorite authors. What I find truely amazing about this story is that deals with things such as aerial warfare but was written in 1913 when people were still debating if airplanes could ever have military value.Although the author was looking to the future with life on Mars and flying battleships, his values are anchored in the Victorian era. John Carter looks to fight the good fight, rescue the damsels in distress and still stay true to his princess. He's a think man's Conan and a monogumous James Bond all rolled into one. The plot line takes several unexpected turns and your pulse will be pounding as the story builds towards its climax.The story is written in the flowery prose that were typical of the Victorian era and it takes a little getting used to. As another reviewer mentioned, you just need to slow down, sit back and enjoy this one. It's definately worth it.The copy I had was about a few years old and the binding completely came apart and as I tried to keep the pages in order while reading I felt like I had uncovered a first addition from 1913. Normally, I would not have been to happy about that, but given the situation it just added charachter to the experience.If you pick this book up, make sure you also get a copy of the next book in the series &quot;Warlord of Mars&quot;. Once you finish &quot;Gods of Mars&quot; you'll want to jump right into the next book."

It's only 500 pages but it speaks volumes.I discovered Dostoyevsky a few months ago while I was deployed to Iraq and my literary world will never been the same.I found a copy of ""The Brothers Karamazov"" in a pile of miscellenious books that had been dedicated to troops to boost morale and took it to a literary savvy Lt. Col. I knew. When I showed him my find, he insisted I read Crime and Punishment first. I'm certainly glad I decided to take his advice.Crime and Punishment tells the story of a brutal murder in pre- revolutionary Russa and the emotional torment of the eccentric murderer, Raskolnikov. The book is as dark and suspenseful as anything I've ever read, but it also manages to convey things on the opposite end of the emotional spectrum like redemption and love. My favorite passage of the book (a hard pick, for sure) is when Porfiry, a jovial but formitable detective, interrogates Raskolnikov.The deployment is over, but my infatuation with Dostoyevsky's books has just begun. I'm now reading ""The Idiot"" and enjoying it, though it's too early to see if it matches ""Crime and Punishment.""Whether you are deployed to the farthest reaches of the world or sitting comfortably at home, ""Crime and Punishment"" promises to be an exhilerating read."

Arguably his finest opuses areI Am Legend(1954),The Incredible Shrinking Man(1956) andBid Time Return(1975). The present book written in 1971 is one step behind his best.This is a classic haunted-house & horror novel with enough meat to keep the reader fascinated and unable to put the book down. So, you may ask, why I give it only three stars? Well... due to its clumsy ending with some big loopholes in it.Matheson realize this shortcoming and when he produced the script for the film based on the novel (""The Legend of Hell House"") he gives a slightly different ending but much more satisfactory.The story is as follows: a millionaire is dying and wants desperately to know if there is afterlife survival. He hires three experts, two sensitive and a scientist to obtain an answer from the Belasco House known as Hell House.So these three poor souls plus the scientist's wife are compelled to spend a week of their lives in the haunted place.The House obliges its fame and receives them with all sort of nefarious occurrences and psychic pressure trying to destroy them.It is a very commendable horror story with lumbering ending, be warned.Reviewed by Max Yofre."

Wade,,A1EL0JNPUEIRJ5,Linda B,15/18,5.0,1150070400,Mr MK Didn't Read It. Please Buy and Read It!,"This book is one that everyone, especially those adopted should read. It will give you the answer you always wanted to know. Why were you given up. Mr. MK gave this book a one star and implied that Ann Fesler thought unplanned pregnancies should be disposed of! Ann clearly states in the book that she is an adoptee. She is a very beautiful sucessful person with so many so thankful for what she has done and continues to do to help answer such questions. She also helps heal the birth mothers, like me, (oh, yes, I am Linda and my story is in the book)by showing us healing. Birthparents will find a healing closeness in this book. At the appearance we did in Houston, one of the birth mothers told me she had a horrible time dressing for the occassion as she was afraid of looking like a slut. I was astonded because I had taken my dress back a few times, changed, and exchanged until I was blue in the face, because I was afraid I might look cheap. You see, we can't forget what society thought of us. And to think that any adoptee (like Mr MK's sister) would think that they were someone who would not be alive, would have been aborted, if they had been born after Roe vs Wade, is very painful to consider! Yes, today, there is birth control available, and young people are more knowledgeable. And yes, today, people can keep their babies, not just because of a change of society's views, but due to food stamps, wic, and all types of assistance. We had none of these things. And of all the birth mothers I have met, I have never met one who said they wished abortions had been legal. We loved our babies when they were kicking inside our tummies, we loved them while we were giving birth, and we loved them the day we signed the papers. We signed a paper saying that we would never ever contact our baby or the family, that our child would be gone to us forever. If we had wanted abortion, we would have wanted adoption. We did not want either. We wanted our babies! We did not want our babies taken out of this world or out of our arms. We wanted our babies! And I lied the day I promised to forget I had given birth. I swore that I would find my daughter as soon as she was eighteen. I did and we have been reunited twenty two years. I love her, her children, and I love her parents dearly. I love her mother so very much. She could do what I could not do. She could be a mother. I had two reasons that I told my story for this book. One, I want adoptees to have their birth records, if they want to have them. And my second reason, is I am against abortion. I want abortion to be illegal. Having to place my daughter for adoption nearly killed me, but before Roe vs Wade, I did not have to make a choice on who would ""die"". If you read this book, you will see that Ann Fesler and the birth mothers are not crying because abortion was illegal. Please read this book and make up your own mind! If you read the book and feel differently than I do, please remember it is your right, and I respect that. If you are an adoptee, be sure that someone somewhere is saying a prayer for you tonight. You are very much loved."

Also how if a violent crime occurs and the victim is black and the perpetrator white it often becomes a a national hysteria, whereas black on white crimes, which are staggeringly more common are buried if not out and out intentionally covered up. He points out all the typical things that these respectable quasi racists talk about, affirmative action, unfair hiring practices, academic/leftist hypocrisy, etc.Here's where I have a problem with Taylor. He, as is typical of right wingers, both racial, and non racial, big on whining about welfare and social programs. Well I live in a Scandinavian country that puts a lot of money into social programs and I've seen firsthand how they benefit a society if you have a society where the majority isn't complete scum. The biggest thing though is Taylor is completely detached from working class white people. He is Yale educated and grew up going to private schools in Japan and I believe France also. He is totally out of touch with how life is for poor, working and middle class whites. He is more or less trying to sell himself off to upper class whites and conservative Jews. There is no criticism of capitalism in this book and of course he doesn't dare say the ""J"" word or claim that what is going on is intentional social engineering from the highest levels of society. Its all the just misguided leftists setting government policies and caving in to system controlled black rabblerousers like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton that are the problem in his world. If your not a stiff right winger I would recomend Jim Goads Redneck Manifesto way before anything written by the Jared Taylors or Pat Buchanans of the world."
0060095288,Fire Lover,7.99,AH3ZQ8AVKKYI5,Sammy Madison,4/4,5.0,1166486400,exciting true crime!,"""Fire Lover"" is an very exciting and well-written true crime book by Joseph Wambaugh, the author famous for writing ""The Onion Field"". The descriptions of fires, vehicle chases and other action sequences are so clear and thrilling you really feel like you are there. It drew me in from the very beginning, with an extremely realistic account of three simultaneous and deadly fires in Pasadena, California businesses on October 10, 1984. Clues eventually lead to arson investigator John Orr as the arsonist in these and a series of other fires. Orr, it turns out, was a legend in his own mind who used the fire investigation as the basis for a poorly written book. I was glad that Wambaugh did not neglect Orr's early life. I always want a true crime author to answer the question ""why"", and there was more information about Orr's background than I had expected. Fascination with fire is a big indication of psychopathology. I did a little skipping, though. Emphasis on the scenes inside the courtroom got a little tiresome. Well-written and very vivid, ""Fire Lover"" is by far one of the best true crime books I have ever read."
B000MOOAJG,Atlas Shrugged,,,,1/2,4.0,937958400,Vastly misrepresented in other reviews,"When reading through the reviews of Atlas Shrugged, I couldn't believe how many reveiwers misrepresented Rand's philosophy, and it was coming from her supporters as well as her critics. I don't know if a lot of readers really understand that ALL of her philosophy was derived from the belief that the human mind is a rational and capable tool. Everything else stems from that. Anyway, I found it especially amusing when one reviewer claimed that Rand was just ripping off the Libertarianist view, when she her novels were the prime influence of the group's creation! Geez! Some readers are so appalled that they resort to mindless personal attacks on the author, when they, of course, know very little about her. The bottom line: If you're interested in the philosophy, read the book (and The Fountainhead). If you'd like to know the whole story, read Atlas, The Fountainhead, The Passion of Ayn Rand (by Barbara Branden), and My Years with Ayn Rand (by Nathaniel Branden)."

A dark novel, it is quite intreging, drawing one into the complex and whimsically dark dream world of the characters. The novel is truly able to contrast the wild depths of one's soul with the civilized, although repressed areas through the contrast of the two houses and the people who reside there. Heathcliff, although dispicable, is someone we can sympathize with...savage and unrefined, he extends beyond humanity, becoming a character of pure passion. Cathy also exists as a refined and civilized form of that same passion, which is why she can love both the dainty Edgar and the wild Heathcliff. The children carry on the parents lives, and, eventually setting their mistakes right and bringing order through their marriage. Heathcliff too has a poignant changing scene, in which we realize that he is not evil, but has just succumbed to this because of his pain and sorrow. My favorite scene is the last between Cathy and Hareton, ending with Heathcliff's death....it was simply beautiful and contrasted with the novel's darkness. The style too was mesmerizing....Bronte's poetic language is beautiful and full of meaning...fiting perfectly with the characters. All and all, it is an excellent novel, but complex, and anything but light and simple. Jane Eyre may be better, but if you like it, read this too, it's worth your while."

B000H2EZ3E,Life On The Mississippi,,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,Newton Ooi,3/4,5.0,1142985600,Timeless commentary,"Few books exist that speak thru the ages by examining themes and situations that confront people of all time. This is one of those books. Unlike Twain's other classics, the focus of this piece is not America, or topics from American history (i.e. slavery), but more general themes such as industrialization, freedom, religion and religious dogma, government control, the meaning of progress, and individual aspirations versus peer pressure.In short, this book focuses on the adventures of Hank Morgan, a Connecticut Yankee who falls asleep one day, and wakes up in England during the reign of King Arthur. This world of knights, damsels, poor hygiene, and overbearing Christian dogma seems ripe for change for our protaganist. Hank proceeds to introduce ""progress"" to this new (old) world in the form of practices, knowledge, and inventions he is familiar with from his time; post Civil War USA. He does this in the name of bettering the lives of those around him, both physically, and emotionally. The result is utter chaos, the destruction of the existing social order, and lessons in colonialism, nation-building, and culture shock that all missionaries, soldiers, politicians and businessmen should heed.Along the way, the book brought both tears and laughter to this reader. One of Twain's strengths is his ability to bring emotion to commonday events by portraying them from various viewpoints. This trait is on display here in its most tragi-comedic form. Overall, a great book."

Along the way they meet giant spiders, evils, horrifying wolves, and a subterranean creature named Gollum from which Bilbo wins a magical ring. By the time Bilbo returns to his home he is a completely different person and ready for bigger more dangerous adventures This is a great book full of adventure. It will appeal to the minds and hearts of adults and children enticing them with its wild happenings and colorful descriptions.

B000JMKVBW,Thirteen Moons: A Novel,,AGQ8CMFCEXM8H,Orthodox Lutheran Reader,2/3,4.0,1167350400,"Not a Cold Mountain, but worthy in its own right","Those who have read Charles Frazier's Cold Mountain can know why many, including myself, consider it a book in a class of its own. And so, Charles Frazier's second book, Thirteen Moons, is worth a read, a review, and a comment or two.Charles Frazier in Thirteen Moons treads well not to make his latest novel a retread of Cold Mountain. Yet, Thirteen Moons is still all Frazier: A reverential awe for nature pervades the book, especially the raw, mountainous land of the eastern Carolinas--a plaintive, nostalgic voice skeining its way through the textFrazier has the storyteller's art, big as the open frontier in the North America of old. He is a craftsman of words, wielding his pen as finely honed knife edge. Frazier brings us in to gaze more closely at animal and fauna, hear the flow of unforced water, and smell the mustiness of an Indian cabin. His metaphors are natural, arising from the landscape or some aspect of Cherokee life. Truly, Frazier's strength is his way with words to paint a living landscape in the reader's mind.Sadly, the strengths of Thirteen Moons cannot counterweigh a grandiose story that lacks focus. The novel has dozens of micro-stories or seeming novellas--all well-told, some delightful, some haunting. The book, like the novel's main character, Will Cooper, wanders somewhat aimlessly, having great insights that lead to nowhere much. Thirteen Moons is no Cold Mountain, close, but not up to its calibre.I haven't given away the book's plot or main ideas in this review. And that's for a reason. Despite its weaknesses, I find Thirteen Moons a worthy read and recommend it heartily--with a qualification. Thirteen Moons is for those who joy in the journey and do not fret much about the destination. If you are all about the ends and care little of the means, this novel is not for you. Yet, if you can revel in a series of stories well-told, of descriptive landscapes, tales that tell of the human condition, then this book is for you--despite its loose plot and 'overtold' story.I'm delighting in the good of the book so well done that its deficiencies matter little to me. Look inside, O reader, to see if this book is for you."

5557096396,A Farewell to Arms,,A7SSCDSCM4PXF,booknblueslady,1/1,4.0,1316304000,War and love,"A Farewell to Arms is Ernest Hemingway's story of war and love set in Italy during World War I. Hemingway uses his earnest sparse journalistic style to tell the story through the perspective of volunteer ambulance driver Frederic Henry a young architecture student from the United States. Frederic is a young man who noticed the landscape around him the fields, the mountains, the humidity, the crops, the buildings and the roads and rivers. He has an easy camaraderie with the soldiers around him. As Frederic returns from leave he states:""I left them working, the car looking disgraced and empty with the engine open and parts spread on the work bench, and went in under the shed and looked at each of the cars. They were moderately clean a few freshly washed, the others dusty. I looked at the tires carefully, looking for the cuts or stone bruises. Everything seemed in good condition. It evidently made no difference whether I was there to look after things or not. I had imagined that the condition of the cars, whether or not things were obtainable, the smooth functioning of the business of removing wounded and sick from the dressing stations, hauling them back from the mountains to the clearing station and then distributing them to the hospitals named on their papers, depended on a considerable extent on myself. Evidently it did not matter whether I was there or not.""He soon meets a young Scottish nurse named Catherine Barkley and they begin to fall in love during the difficult wartime setting. It is interesting that Hemingway who has such dynamic conversations between comrades in arms has such banal and saccharine conversations between the two young lovers. Through hardships and difficulties they never seem to progress beyond smoochy, smoochy.With Hemingway's spare style he has chiseled Catherine down to a shell. She doesn't exist as a solid being without Frederic whose voice we constantly here though rarely do we here his name. It is surely written in full no more than five times in the book. And yet in his commentary on war, we read that it is indeed the names that are concrete and real:""I did not say anything. I was always embarrassed by the words sacred, glorious, and sacrifice and the expression in vain. We had heard them, sometimes standing in the rain almost our of earshot, so that only the shouted words came through, and I had read them, on proclamations that were slapped up by billposters over other proclamations, now for a long time and I had seen nothing sacred, and the things that were glorious had no glory and the sacrifices were like the stockyards at Chicago if nothing was done with the meat except to bury it. There were many words that you could not stand to hear and finally only the names of places had dignity. Certain numbers were the same way and certain dates and with the names of the places were all you could say and have them mean anything. Abstract words such as glory, honor, courage, or hallow were obscene beside the concrete names of villages , the numbers of roads a, the names of rivers, the numbers of regiments and the dates.""When one examines the plot, it is quite wonderful and exciting, with the daring and dangerous escapades one expects of a war time story, combined with the angst and yearning of young love. While it may not be an antiwar novel in the truest sense A Farewell to Arms certainly provides a realistic look to the confusion of war along with a look at the common valor which goes with being a soldier.While it may not be everyone's cup of tea for a variety of reasons, A Farewell to Arms surely deserves its place among the classics."

Don't turn to the answer too fast.This book is the third in the series, but the books do not have to be read in order. I loved the Encyclopedia Brown books when I was growing up.

The description of the feelings and scenery is wonderful, but doesn't overly describe, so there's a lot of legroom for you imagination. The characters Jem and Scout were fully three dimensional and grew with the book. Atticus was the perfect parent, and always led his children in the right direction and told them the truth without being harsh. Overall the book, was absoulutly great, but there was only one thing I didn't like. After the book was done, it leaves the reader wondering what happens to Jem, Scout, Dill and Boo. Does Scout marry Dill? Does Jem decide to be a lawyer like Atticus? Other than that, I found the book to be excellent"

Anne Moody's autobiography, &quot;Coming of Age in Mississippi&quot; is a wonderful book that tells the story of Anne's struggles growing up poor and black in the rural south. The author captures the reader's attention in the first few paragraphs using some slang dialect. We had vivid pictures in our minds of what was happening in the story through all of the use of imagery. There is a vivid image of a &quot;rotten wood two room shack&quot; as you read the pages. This book is well written and easy to read. It also helps one realize how many small steps it takes for ones dreams of a wonderful future to come true. We would love to meet Anne Moody, and we are thanking her for enabling us to get a glimpse of her life."
B000NOWYR0,Tender Is the Night,,,,0/2,3.0,904348800,This novel is more revealing about Fitzgeral than the 1920's,"I read &quot;Gatsby&quot; and was awed by Fitzgerald's ability to both describe the 1920's and to draw his readers into that postwar period. His characters felt real to me. So, I couldn't wait to read Tender is the Night. &quot;Tender&quot; seems to reveal more about Fitzgerald personal pain than anything else. His novel elaborately blames Nicole for Dick's emotional decay. To me, this story line just doesn't bear close scrutiny. Dick's behavior is controlling,habitually deceitful and at times misogynistic. Time after time Dick control's Nicole's actions and refuses to allow her to even discuss her viewpoint. Nicole's behavior is unbalanced but is it schizophrenic?It's very revealing that a 28 year old man would fall in love with a 16 year old girl. Later, when Nicole has grown up a bit, Dick falls in and out of love with Rosemary, a very child-like 18 year old.Granted, women's rights were along way off in 1925 the year Fitzgerald began writing Tender is the Night, but Dick seems more in charge of Nicole's life than seems warranted by either the prevailing culture or by Nicole's illness.I'd say that Fitzgerald unconsciously revealed his own role in his decaying marriage and like most folks tried to point the finger elsewhere."

B000GROP62,Nineteen Eighty-four,,A2KBM9RXIYYDK1,Micaela Bisio,2/2,5.0,1149379200,2+2=5,"I found this novel extremely thought provoking. It is a book every young and old American should read to learn what could easily happen to their civilization or rather what is happening. George Orwell is acting as a visionary in telling a story that is becoming reality more each day. It is frightening to think if the government in our society is not stopped they can become equally as corrupt as the Party in Oceania. The thought that the government not only controls what you are doing each day, but also controls how you think is terrifying.The brilliant novel kicks off with Winston Smith, a member of the Party, climbing up flights of stairs with his throbbing varicose ulcer aching. The thirty-nine year old goes through his life second guessing the Party and all it stands for. Winston starts by recording his thoughts in a diary. After reviewing his thoughts he even wondered if he himself was indeed a lunatic. Through the book he is running from the dreaded Thought Police. Winston became involved with Julia another enemy of Big Brother. They met up secretly in multiple hiding spots. There they exchanged words about their combined hatred for the Party which followed with romantic pleasantries between the two. Inevitably the two are captured and brought to the Ministry of Love where their minds were molded into the stupid followers of the Party. At the conclusion Winston gives his soul up to the Party.This is a must read for all individuals. Even though written as a fiction novel the story 1984, can be linked to parts of today's society despite the fact that the year itself has since passed. The way the novel is able to draw in readers and immediately involve them in what events are occurring in the novel, is simply mind boggling. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a sense of excitement for the book they are reading."

But he's not a short-term thinker; much of the book deals with his ideas of Mars colonization and the eventual terraformation of the planet. Although much of it may be overly optimistic, there are no proposals which seem impossible; everything Zubrin discusses in this could, in theory, be done. Some of the best writing within the book deals not with the technical aspects of sending a mission to Mars, but Zubrin's heartfelt reasons for WHY such a mission should be sent in the first place. I recommend this book to anyone."

0394603753,Catch-Twenty-Two,,A3RXDBDA93FZLC,Philip Alsop,0/0,5.0,1076889600,If you looked up &quot;paradox&quot; in the dictionary...,"Catch-22: the only thing that can define a book that seethes with paradox, contradiction, and twisted reasoning. The novel is set in the closing months of the Second World War, on a little island off the coast of Italy. Heller skillfully depicts a generation of people who are used against their will and the sheer helplessness of their resistance to the system. What makes this piece of literature so clever is how Heller uses his characters, which seem so real, to create many instances of contradiction and questionable logic. For example, Major Major, who will only see people in his office he himself is not in it. Or Commanding Officers who care more about well shot aerial photographs of bomb targets than actually bombing the target. And the most twisted contradiction of all: the main character's (Yossarian) iron will to survive the war, or die trying.The novel stays fresh by unfolding many side stories that involve Yossarian's relationship with other characters. This, of course, tells the reader more about the men in the Bomber Division, but it also reveals more about Yossarian himself and his attempts to get himself out of as many missions as possible. Other characters present many of the recurring themes in the novel, such as faith. The division's chaplain, Chaplain Tappman, spends all his time preaching from the Good Book in hospitals and to the men, but at the same time, doubts everything he says, and the Lord's existence. Also, Yossarian's superior officers reveal the absolute weakness of language: while it offers no reassurance to those facing death, or those who could meet it, it offers the power of officers to trap their men in a hopeless prison of the army or in a grander scheme of things, bureaucracy.By the time I finished this book, I was again presented with another contradiction: while this book is serious, sad, and incredibly thought-provoking, it's quite the funny read."
B000HNPFSC,Ulysses (International Collectors Library),,A3RTMB76CJWY9U,DonAthos,48/75,1.0,1111708800,A Difference of Opinion,"Random House, calling on English Professors and other literary professionals, declared James Joyce's Ulysses as the greatest novel of the 20th Century.Who am I to disagree?While I may not have too many initials following my name, I'd like to believe that my opinion about Ulysses is valid in its own right. After all, I have taken the trouble to read the thing. Also, I have a bachelor's degree, and have taught High School English. I've also read an exegesis of Ulysses, and am currently reading Finnegans Wake, so I do have something in the way of qualifications. At heart, I account my opposing opinion to the fact that I believe that the standards that I use to judge the merits of a novel are different than those employed by the fellows at Random House. Further, I think that my criteria aren't necessarily all that bad.Indeed, I like to believe that my criteria are probably closer to what most people look for in a novel.The things that I look for in a novel include: an exciting plot; memorable, interesting characters; clean, crisp writing.The things that I believe the Random House voters look for in a novel include: intricate word play; obscure literary allusion/allegory; originality in form and syntax, even to the point of obfuscation.Ulysses certainly is a winner in the second category, as all eight hundred pages of it concern one man on one day in his life. Most of those pages are devoted to word play, literary allusions, experiments in literary form, etc. What Ulysses does not spend a lot of time on, however, is developing plot and character--the things I love in a good book. There is almost no clean, crisp writing to be found--Joyce's primary consideration was not to be understood; he wanted to be *clever*.For instance, take the ""word overture."" At the beginning of the ""Siren section,"" (Ulysses is modeled after The Odyssey), Joyce mirrors the overture of a musical by running together out-of-context fragments and snatches of words from the chapter to come. He does this without preamble or explanation and reading it is a very confusing experience. But Joyce didn't write it with the intention of being clear--he had something artistic to say, or something experimental to try, or something like that. Please understand that this makes Joyce very, very different from most of the masters who preceeded him, such as Thomas Hardy, Leo Tolstoy, Charles Dickens, Victor Hugo, etc. They wrote in an effort to communicate themselves very clearly; Joyce wants to be difficult. They wanted to write interesting stories, Joyce wants something altogether different.For myself, I neither like Joyce's style nor his intentions. I honestly cannot figure out the point, other than cleverness for cleverness' sake. Further, I believe that his method, which has become the main literary aesthetic in schools (which is why they all concentrate so much on literary devices such as metaphor and allegory), has been detrimental to education. By turning literature from entertaining stories into puzzle solving, I believe he has turned many children away from reading. I think this helps to account for, say, J.K. Rowling's success. It's not that kids don't like to read, it's that they don't like to read things like Ulysses or similar efforts by Joyce's admirers.Many people reading this will likely disagree with me. They think that Joyce was a ""genius."" That's fine--they're entitled to their opinions. But, I'm entitled to mine as well, and, in my opinion, Ulysses does not say nearly enough of importance to be worth all the trouble it is to decode, and in the end it is simply not a lot of fun. In my opinion, there are tons of other books that have just as much of value (if not more), and *also* have exciting plots, interesting characters and clear writing. Joyce was, perhaps, a genius at puzzle-writing and encoding, but Ulysses is a poor novel."

While this lacks (in my opinion) the energy of &quot;Dombey and Son&quot; (1848), &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1850), &quot;Bleak House&quot; (1853), or &quot;Hard Times&quot; (1854), it is still a phenomenal piece of literature. Pip is an interesting creation. First we see him as a small child who is victimized by his sister. His brother in law Jo (while not too bright) never approves of Pip's abuse. It is interesting that Dickens wrote this troubled marriage scene soon after his own divorce! It is also painfully tragic when Pip starts to make his way into the world and he has to realize that the kind hearted but simple Jo has to take a back seat to his success. Jaggers offers some welcome comical touches. It is interesting that Pip becomes victimized by a legitimate colleague Orlick and as it turns out, the old thief was his benefactor. (In my opinion the old thief was a literary reincarnation of Fagin.) To this day, I have never forgotten the chills when I discovered that the old thief in the early part of the novel was his benefactor. So we have domestic quarrles, true to life tragic events, strong images, comical touches, and surprise events!"

In the last year, I'm trying my best effort to absorb knowledge of Chaos Theory, Complexity, and Catastrophe Theory. It's quite hard to get a in-depth guild of the above knowledge to common people in Hong Kong.My purpose to get the above knowledge is just in order to find the hidden order of financial market, and, of course, to make profit from the market. That's why I find this book is good to serve my purpose. It explained clearly on fractals, the relationship between chaos and order, and non-linearness.I knew E. Peters has using fratals / Elloit Wave Theory to analyze financial market. Of course, it needs more intra-day data to try to find such fratals in a small scale period, e.g. in a 5-minute charts. But I guess that, such fractal are existing in the market, if you watching index movement everyday.On another aspest, the technique of plotting data in a phase space is a tool to get the picture of financial market to me. This tools can be compared with weighted moving average, MACD, or other technical indicators. Though, phase space analysis is quite uneasy to a man without advanced mathematics. I'm quite sure such mathematical technique may apply to financial trading.Besides, the idea of &quot;quasi-periodic&quot; is likely describing financial market. Though I got less knowledge from the book on this topic. It sounds like some ideas from William Gann, and other cyclist writings.Hince, I'm benefitted from the book to enlighten new view point to see the world, and the market. I recommend any financial market practitioner to read this Chaos Theory guild and then reread some technical analysis classics, and reviewing their trading strategies. I believe that shall be worthy in one's trading life.N.B. The picture 2.7 is missing (P.76), and there is some printing errors in its Chinese version which printed in 20.6.1997"

B0008EH6Q4,Sunshine,,A1N0AWBBMP9JXT,Cinnamon,4/4,5.0,1105747200,"No, it isn't traditional Robin Mckinley, but....","To be frank, I love this book. I picked it up simply because it was by one of my favorite authors. I was expecting a good, lyrical, adolesent fantasy novel with intriguing characters. When I finished it (the same night I got it) I didn't know what to think, it was just so different from what I had expected. Still in a state of shock (probably aided by not having eaten any dinner) I re-read it. When I finished the second time I knew I had found my favorite Robin McKinley book. This may seem strange because Sunshine deals with radically different themes then any of RMcK's other books, reading it you wouldn't even think it was by the same person. I think is why so many of her die-hard fans got turned off.Yes, I do know Sunshine has a few flaws, but I love it despite them. Quite a few of the minor characters are not developed very well, for example, we don't have a single conversation with Rae's mother throughout the entire book, but I view this as the author writing through Rae's sterotyped viewpoint. Because Rae see's her mother one way, that is how we see her. If the book was written from Charley's viewpoint I'm sure we would get a totally different picture of her mom. There are also a lot of loose ends in this book, but isn't that how life really is? I personally dislike books that wrap everything up in a neat little package and, to be honest, the little (and rather big) mysteries left to solve have kept me thinking about Sunshine long after I would have normally.Reviewers have said that children under 15 should not read this, but I personally believe that's being over-protective. I first read this at an early 13 and I wasn't shocked by the little ""scene"" near the middle of the book. Maybe I'm just very mature for my age (15 now) but I was a lot more under-sex-educated then most other kids my age and if it didn't faze me then I doubt it would rattle any but the most sheltered 13 year-old.Buy, buy, buy this book and you will love it (especially Con), it has unique twists to the horror/fantasty genre that haven't been done before (or at least in the books I've read). Most importantly: Don't be turned off by ""vampires"" and ""horror"" because it's good even if you were never into vampires before (like me). Also, if the first 30 pages or so seem boring to you, just skip them, you can come back later and read them. That's what my mom did when she read it and she said it seemed a lot more intreasting after she finished the book."

Free of the ethnic racism and stereotyping that blight many similar works of the era, Addams' account of her groundbreaking community center in one of the worst parts of late 19th-century Chicago fairly overflows with compassion and almost unbelievable fairness. Addams's intelligence is evident, and many of her ideas and attitudes seem decades ahead of their time.

B000NQLO2O,A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.),,A2K17SJR32BV9K,"Erika (Jawas Read, Too)",1/1,5.0,1275696000,Legendary Fantasy,"Duny is no ordinary boy. He has a true name, a nickname, and the one given to him at birth. He's a boy shaped around words. In this world words have become very important, especially when it comes to naming. When he leaves for Roke, the magical island renown for its school of magery, it's with youthful fantasies of turning himself into any creature he desires, of changing mundane objects into marvelous ones, and unrealistic ideas of power--with none of responsibility. In the land of Earthsea, names are very powerful; language is the very thing used to harness the world's greatest strengths and manipulate reality the way it was never meant to be.A Wizard of Earthsea (first published in 1968) has the lyrical and romantic command of a legend. It's one of those books I wish I had read as child. I'm sure I would have fallen in love immediately. How could I not? I've already fallen in love. It's adventurous with magic and wonderfully sentient creatures, and a map I found myself placing my finger on to trace the path of Ged's boat. Oh, the map. Earthsea unfurled beneath my fingertips. I could almost feel the mountainous terrain of Gont, the saturated grasses of Roke Knoll, the wintry court of Terrenon. Surprisingly, the map gave a vast scale to a journey that was now measurable by sight as well as description. But description alone would have done the job quite well.Le Guin doesn't seem to waste a phrase. She's mastered her diction and molded a narrative that invites a measured reading. There is no rushing here. The language is poetic; Le Guin's prose lingers long after the book is closed and lifts my mind to the beyond--to worlds we can inhabit only in our dreams and imagination. And what an imagination she has herself--what beautiful writing. Le Guin is at heart a story-teller. She has the type of narrative voice easily read aloud (in fact, I couldn't stop thinking that someone should be reading this to me). There's something organic about her writing, something wonderfully intoxicating that reaches up from the very depths of a tradition that goes further than the printed word.As I read about Ged and his magical quest, finding friends and making enemies along the way, I suddenly found myself feeling as enchanted with the story as I have by only a handful of stories since I was a child. The Hobbit, The Once and Future King, these are books that speak to the soul with some mysterious and intuitive soul language; A Wizard of Earthsea deserves a place of honor next to both. It's as much a coming of age story as it is a tale of a young boy who learns how to test his limits. He develops lasting friendships and comes to understand the darkness deep within himself is tempered only by the light, which he must also recognize.This is a difficult book for me to write about. I don't just want to talk about it, I want to share it with you. The characters sometimes fall into these difficulty childish roles influenced by misunderstandings and jealousies. Ged clearly and quickly identifies Jasper as an enemy, if at first only as a rival in his seniority, due in part to his curiously cultivated, subtly sarcastic attitude. These are characters we must see through Ged's eyes to best understand his motivations and weaknesses. And he is nothing if not prideful and impatient, eager to impress others and become recognized for the glory he imagines in the talent and accomplishments of magery, rather than temperament or restraint.His actions are not only influenced by who he is (or who he thinks he is), but by his intentions. This is a book that contains such subtle and non-subtle messages of responsibility and kindness, honoring the sacrifices of friends, and the intrinsic relationship people share not just with each other, but with all creatures and objects of nature. Ged has to find his place in the world, but to do so, he has to discover his limits. And so he reaches out by islands and boats, on foot and through air, at times running away from or toward his fears, back into the arms of friends and out into palaces of those that wish him no good. He travels everywhere and back again, even to the ends of the world, determined to find equilibrium without ever realizing that is what he yearns for the most. To be at peace is to find balance within one's soul and to accept that which is good and that which is bad. Knowing when and how to act is Ged's most difficult journey and harshest lesson.A Wizard of Earthsea may be a short novel, but it leaves a lasting impression. It's a type of bildungsroman with an awareness of itself as the stuff of fairy tale and legend. The text even refers to itself through the narrator as a story we all must have heard before, concerned with characters we might know in bits and pieces. Whether or not Ged's tale is true, or if different versions conflict with each other, we have this one here which even references other legends and tales outside of itself, but altogether within the realm of Le Guin's fantasy. Surely there's darkness and adventures with perilous and light-hearted outcomes, but Le Guin has created something cognitive and tightly woven. Anyone, no matter the age, will find something to enjoy about it. You never know. Perhaps it will be the dragons."
B000JVNX4K,The Handmaid's Tale,,A3TCZ27XLGC0J1,KA Parry,8/11,4.0,1180137600,A warning to us all,"Margaret Atwood, in this beautifully written but incredibly disturbing fictional novel, describes what could happen if religion gains too much power, and what society could become if women's rights are not protected.The story is set in the United States in the near future. A brutal attack has left all members of Congress dead and the country has collapsed into civil war. A section of the United States, governed by religious fundamentalists, becomes a totalitarian state called the Republic of Gilead. The Constitution is suspended; civil liberties and freedoms are dissolved; the death penalty is instituted for dissidents, homosexuals, and non-Christians; and women loose the right to work and earn money.Radiation poisoning from the war has resulted in almost all women becoming infertile. Those few in Gilead who can still bear children are forced to become Handmaids, surrogate mothers for infertile couples. The book takes the form of a personal diary belonging to a Handmaid named Offred, who is commissioned to the house of a Gileadean commander, and whose sole purpose is to routinely copulate with him in order to bear a child for his infertile wife. Using this as the basis of the story allows Atwood to address the conservative, traditional and sometimes religious belief that the only purpose of a woman is to bear children. In Offred's own words:""We are two-legged wombs, that's all: sacred vessels, ambulatory chalices."" Pg136.and""What we prayed for was emptiness, so we would be worthy to be filled: with grace, with love, with self-denial, semen and babies."" Pg 194.Offred takes the reader through her many trials as she struggles to come to terms with her place in a suppressive and legalistic society. The story frequently flashes back to Offred's memories of her life before the war, when she had her own job, money, a loving husband and a young daughter. This dualistic nature of the story provides the reader with a comparison between two societies: one where women have choice and the other where women have little or no choice at all.This is a dystopian novel, and through it Atwood provides a warning of what could happen if religion becomes the ultimate law of the land, and if women are no longer free to make their own decisions, especially regarding sexuality and reproduction."

Then Snoopy's Guide to the Writing Life is the ideal book to give your writer, on birthdays, on holidays, at graduation.This is as much a book about life as it is a book about writing. This isn't a book about ""the process."" The book won't help you put words on the page, or help you fix your grammar, or describe the best ways of building air-tight plots. What Snoopy's Guide does is far more interesting and far more important--it takes twenty-odd writers and has them talk about about their writing processes, their wins and their losses, and each writer relates their experiences in some way back to Peanuts, which puts their experiences on terms everyone can relate to. Every writer has faced the terror of the blank page, or the title that won't come, or the vagaries of the market. Rather than discuss writing, Snoopy's Guide discusses the writing life, and that makes it a valuable resource to treasure.If you need a gift, Snoopy's Guide would be ideal.

0195169166,Fallen Blue Knights: Controlling Police Corruption (Studies in Crime and Public Policy),38.89,AOPR7VY5SFMYH,Big Blue 6,3/4,2.0,1276905600,B+ term paper,"The author has done a nice job of describing the work, findings, and recommendations of a few of the major investigative commissions that have been formed to address large-scale corruption in large U.S. police departments (e.g., New York, Philadelphia). The commissions she most often cites did their work in the 1970s and 80s, so there are real questions about whether the information is useful today. But if you're looking for a primer on some of the larger investigative commissions, this book may be useful to you; if you're looking for anything else, keep looking.This book is really just a lengthy college term paper. It might be worth a B+ if a college junior had written it, but it was written by a professor (yikes). The book is long on assertions but short on citations/research to back them up (I suspect much of the author's research involved watching cop movies). The Utopian solution proposed by the author probably looks really good to someone sitting on a college campus. But in the real world it's unworkable, if not outright silly. And contrary to the assertions of the back cover reviews, the author offers very little information about the causes of police corrutpion or it's cures. I'll probably avoid reading anything written by Heymann, Moore, or Shearing just based on their horribly inaccurate reviews of this book (I'm guessing they reviewed it without reading it). But, although the book lacks much useful information, the writing itself is actually good - it's clear and organized.The bottom line: If you're an internal affairs investigator, a police manager, a mayor, a city commissioner, or a member of the public interested in police corruption, there is nothing in this book for you. If you're a college professor or student looking to cite a poorly-researched book about commissions that investigated police corruption in the 1970s, this is your book."

In a way this is more fundamental than the question of the Abolition of Man -- in that Lewis's friend, Owen Barfield, spent many years studying and applying Anthroposophy which Lewis in various ways throughout his life contested. (cf. Pilgrim's Regress, by Lewis) Lewis says in the Abolition that Dr. Steiner may indeed have seen what he claims. This is a curious remark of his -- and I would be interested to know if anyone knows more about this apparent change of heart. For Lewis to begin to affirm Anthroposophy goes much further than the argument of the book to point a direction of restoring Man to the world."

B000K0G43C,Fahrenheit 451,,AEW50V65A6ZO,Midnyte Reader,1/1,4.0,1348876800,Fahrenheit 451,"I admit I have never read this important book. Not even for school. Of course I knew what it was about because it is so iconic. A society where reading books is illegal and punishable. The way these criminal readers are punished? Burn not only their books, but their entire houses. Eeek.The story takes place mostly in the head of the main character Guy Montag. He is a fireman in a dystopian, alternate society. Fireman are responsible for burning things that are dangerous, case in point, books. But Guy has an awakening of conscience after meeting Clarissa, his teenage neighbor, who asks him questions that he is now forced to think about whether he likes it or not and after a woman decides to burn with her books.The story is a great deal of Montag's thoughts as he deals with his new views. They are written as a stream of conscience and there is very little container, although I could see the little house where he and his wife lived and his neighborhood and even the woods where he sought refuge. Some of the details were confusing to me at times, but they didn't take away from the context of the story.Bradbury's style is staccato and reminded me of the militant society in which the story took place. This made for powerful thoughts and ideas. It is emotional and sometimes just downright heartbreaking.The narrator is good, but I felt his voice and language a bit forced at times. I also think that for me, an audio book was the way to go for Fahrenheit 451. I'm not sure I would have been able to get out of it what I did had I been reading it myself.I can't say I enjoyed this book, but I'm glad I gave it a try. I find myself thinking about that alternate world, a world without books because different ideas are dangerous, because different views lead to trouble. Burn out anything that is politically incorrect or the least bit offensive and soon you have a sterile setting. In this world, only being entertained and pursuing pleasures are encouraged. The pursuit of philosophy will just make people unhappy because they will see how unfair life is.I like the character Clarissa, the young girl who had her mind and her eyes open. She is innocent and represents that in the way she asks questions and daydreams and wonders. I thought the wife Millie interesting because although it is apparent that she is unhappy, that she is aware something is wrong with this existence, she shuts it away and pretends everything is fine.I liked afterward by Bradbury who talks of editing and likens it to the reasons given in his book. He quotes ""There is more than one way to burn a book."" He also wrote a play re-visiting the characters of F-451 and said the one who revealed the most is Baty, the Fire Chief. Baty, it turns out, in this play has thousands of books. BUT, he never reads them. The law states you cannot read them, but it doesn't state you cannot have them. He diabolically lets them die because they are never read.This wasn't the easiest book to get through for me, but it is an important one that everybody, especially book lovers, should give a try."

With 444 pages of material and also quite a lot of references to back up the chapters this book is exceptional. Bollet covers a multitude of areas in the world of the medical care featuring early war ill-preparation, being overwhelmed, medical science, surgery, amputations, wounds, hospitals, drugs, diseases, prison camps and important individuals of the time. Every chapter offers added insight featuring biographies on people that may have had influence on the subject being written about that adds more intrigue to this book. This book is very comprehensive and fair to all parties involved often bringing to light the importance of doctors and nurses through out the entire war and it's aftermath. Another interesting aspect of this book is that it discourages the myths and stereotypes of doctors during the Civil War that have survived to this day. I recommend this book to anyone who studies medicine or the Civil War as much insight can be gained from this very thorough book."

This missionary family learned the value of Christian community under impossible circumstances; they learned the need to ""rest"" in the Providence of a faithful God; they learned to live one day at a time; they learned that no external political force can make a substantive ""dent"" in personal faith nor have power to discourage or defeat unless that power is give to them. In all, we all need to learn these lessons. I read this book many years ago and have re-read it a number of times in the years since. Its lessons never cease to instruct me and to act as a corrective to my attitudes that become askew as I live in a materialistic, self-absorbed culture."

James is obviously surprised and attracted when he meets Jesse again. Also, he is jealous! Every time she goes out in her new dresses, he can hardly believe his eyes. &quot;Trollop,&quot; is the name he uses mostly to describe her, but you know it is just because he dosen't want anyone else to feel like he feels about her. If that isn't a blossoming love, I don't know what is. Also, the incidents leading up to Jesse's transformation were hysterical. It was heartwarming to see her try to save James from Glenda. The plot was interesting, and the secret of Blcakbeard's diary added much intrigue. One dissapointment is that you expect more time to be devoted to the treasure. All in all, it is an extremly well written book with interesting word choice, excellent organization, interesting side plots, and a wonderful love that turns the book into the treasure that is being sought."

There are two handy dividers built into the front and back covers that let you save mementos and/or receipts, which is great when you have to deal with customs. This isn't a travel journal/diary, but it's great for being able to tell a friend how to find the restaurant that wasn't in the guidebooks or exactly where you bought the purse she's been dying to get.

Over-all, i just think that this book could have been so much better. JM didnt seem to have delved too deeply into the characters. Usually, in her novels, i have a deep and probably intimate knowledge of the characters i.e. Matt Farrel in Paradise; but in this novel...i couldnt really comprehend Wyatt...its like he dosent really have much of a character except for the fact that he is wealthy and dislikes cecil. I couldnt understand his actions...i couldnt even tell when he was confused. The ending wasnt as great either. it was a nice romantic wedding but..there wasnt any mention of Danny or how Julie, meridith, and Kate became friends. Everything was basically left for assumation. And i seriouly wanted to know something about Wyatts mother....but i guess JM wasnt interested.allthough this book boasts the fact that the characters from her other best novels, Paradise and Perfect, are in there, they werent mentioned very often. Once the characters were introduced to the reader as well as the heroine, there was simply no interaction between the two. There was no bridge of bondage for even the female characters...this book was kind of a dissapointment. I've been looking forward to this book directly after ""someone to watch over me"", but i find that it wasnt even worth the wait.I suggest that you just wait for it to come out in paperback or borrow it from a friend. it dosent even look like the book will be as thick as Paradise or Perfect."

I am tired of both, because as much as it is handy to refer to computer data storage as &quot;memory,&quot; it really is nothing like human memory, and as much as my mother sees ghouls of Alzheimer's over every lost pen, the truth is that her memory isn't as good as, well, as she remembers it being.Without being about pathology, this book is about the fallibility of memory; or rather I should say, the failure of memory to live up to the expectations that we have for it. Actually, this book has made me think about the purpose and function of memory, and I've concluded that it actually works rather well; if we had little videocameras in our frontal lobes, they wouldn't serve us as well as the memory functions we actually have, and in fact, this is the subject of the final chapter.The seven &quot;sins&quot; of memory are transience, absent-mindedness, blocking, misattribution, suggestibility, bias and persistence.Transience is the deterioration of memory over time, other than traumatic memory-- Persistence is the stubbornness of traumatic memory to fade. Absent-mindedness is failure to pay attention to something unusual that happens while performing a task by rote. Misattribution is attributing one feature of a memory to another-- remembering a childhood friend by his dog's name, for example. Blocking is the &quot;tip of the tongue&quot; phenomenon. Bias is coloring old memories with present knowledge.There is no branch of study, from cranial anatomy, to neurochemistry, to performance psychology, to forensics, that he does not probe for usefulness. I applaud him for undertaking this project. In general, his writing is clear and concise. If occasionally he seems to belabor a point, this is something his editors should have corrected, and I don't take him to task for it. Skim through and go on."

Col.,2/2,4.0,1277164800,Good read but not exceptional,"I decided to read Pierre Boulle's ""The Bridge Over the River Kwai"" because I had greatly enjoyed David Lean's famous 1957 film adaptation. Overall the novel makes for relatively quick reading and doesn't bog down in complexity as some books do for better or worse. The plot essentially follows two parallel stories heading towards an intersection at the climax. One story is a satirical tale of a British POW colonel who's pride lead him to help the Japanese build a railway bridge at the expense of his suffering men. The other plot line follows a trio of British commandos planning on destroying the bridge. Parts of the book are quite close to the film although major differences exist as well (e.g. no William Holden character, somewhat different ending). Like the film, the novel is highly fictionalized. For a more accurate depiction of the Thai Burma railway I would recommend Ernest Gordon's memoir ""To End all Wars"" or the somewhat fictionalized film adaptation of the same name. Overall ""The Bridge over the River Kwai"" is a readable book but one that doesn't in my opinion equal the film. It held my interest but was certainly not exceptional."

It has all the seaminess and sharply drawn characters you expect to find in noir. The story is told by the sister who reveals more of her character than she realizes.

I remember kids talking about this book just a few years ago when I was in high school and remember thinking it was some great new work of sci-fi. With all the changes in our society and culture the past few years (from the Internet to digital television), FAHRENHEIT 451 is more significant today than it was forty years ago.The plot of the story is simple. Guy Montag is a fireman. However, in the future, instead of putting out fires, fireman start them. Guy burns books and he enjoys doing it. Books are illegal to own and most people spend their free time (and they have lots of it) driving their cars (at speeds of over 120 mph) or listening to the wall-sized televisions that have become their family. One day Guy meets a strange girl who sets a fancy to his heart. His meeting with her allows him to open up and begin to see the truth.The story is simple, but it is what the story says about our society that is so significant. We are told by the story's antagonist that things changed because the country became divided by factions of every sort and people no longer cared about the knowledge books contained. Reading forces people to think and thinking is bad because it forces you to consider others and when you only care about yourself, how can you think about someone else? In our modern American society where many people label themselves with as many hypens as possible, where lives are literally being played out on television, and where violence is becoming more and more the norm; the issues raised in FAHRENHEIT 451 need to be discussed more than ever."

Higgins had garnered a lot of critical acclaim, I believe, based mostly on another novel, The Friends of Eddie Coyle, that I've never read. And I don't think that I ever will after slogging through this one.Here's my primary complaint. This book is composed almost entirely of dialogue. There is no action whatsoever! I think this is a fatal mistake, considering what this novel is about.A privileged group of pseudo-radicals finance their 'movement' through a series of daylight heists of armored cars. They are eventually caught after they decide to expand their crime spree to include the robbery of a Boston bar/restaurant fronting for drug dealers. The result is 7 people shot to death, execution style. All this sounds exciting, doesn't it?Well, it AIN'T!! The reader is not privy to any action scenes at all. All that happens is that we get characters talking about what happened, after the fact. For one example, the state police discuss their plan to capture this group of armed thugs. Then, the next day, we're told how the plan worked to perfection, and everyone is in custody. UGH!! This makes for really dull reading.The plot itself is relatively interesting, actually. As a lifelong Bostonian, I usually like novels that take place here in this area. But not this time. Yes, I recognized the places where the characters were sitting when they discussed the real plot of the book, but so what?The funny thing is that this probably could have made a pretty good movie, considering the subject matter, in the hands of an action director. But as a novel, it's really dull. There's a lot of potential here, in the plot, but Higgins mismanaged it terribly."

No matter how we frame the destruction of our country's output, how we have slipped behind the rest of the world, how we have been reduced to a shell of activity that manipulates money and forces false appreciation of asset values while producing nothing of substance, we cannot explain how it came to be. Like the decline in Rand's world, we are following the same path. As a business owner for 30 years, Rand was the first person to ever truly make me feel good about profits, growth and my individual chase of truth. I hid behind my achievement, today I celebrate it. Today I see the work of the looters. The tragic wasting of minds as they are stripped of value through a government and school system that lives off them.

We all know this might help a little for someone who has never exercised and eats poorly. After all, 30 minutes may be better than nothing, but it really just doesn't cut it for people who want overall health and want to lose weight and build muscle for the long term.Like they say, any exercise program that tells you it's this way or no way, or any diet that tells you to cut out foods groups all together, are probably all bogus.

We want Beth to recover, but she does not. We want Jo and Laurie to marry, but that doesn't happen. Or at least for neither to be complete without the other. But again, no. Life does not cohere like that, and neither does this story. The dead remain stark dead and the ""true loves"" find other loves that they ultimately find truer. And that is striking; very realistic, very wonderful. Also probably why this story works better than Little Men, which was not based as much on reality.Some postscript notes: the earlier parts of the book are best, before we become depressed by the dual disappointments. It peaks when it tells about Beth's final days, that poor, gentle soul. I'm pretty hardened, but that got to even me -- well, a little, anyway."

The Orange County culture he investigates includes the ultra-rich, Vietnamese merchants and gangs, and an insane young man who flirts with genius.It is the characters that make THE ORANGE CURTAIN stand out although certainly author John Shannon handles adventure well enough (with both physical and psychological challenges to Liffey). Both Liffey and insane Billy Gudger have their own challenges in dealing with others, rendering Liffey the one man who may be able to communicate effectively with Billy.Shannon's touch for characters also applies to minor characters. Liffey's daughter Maeve, for example, is a delightful 13 going on 30.THE ORANGE CURTAIN is less a mystery to be solved than it is a set of observations into human nature, the intermingled but distinct societies of Southern California, and the challenges a man must face to stand himself in the morning. Does that sound heavy? In this case, it isn't. The novel is a fast read with several great a-ha moments.Highly Recommended."

You must focus on the things said instead of the things done. With that in mind, I was profoundly moved by Mr. Dimmesdale's fears and worries, Mr. Chillingworth's cunning complexity, Hester Prynne's quiet silent attitude, and Pearl's devilish actions. Each character in the story was so amazing 3-dimensional.Yes, there are parts in the book that are more verbose than I would have liked, and that is why I rated it a 4. I just learned to ignore those parts that didn't really seem to pertain to the major ideas of the story, and instead focus on those words and feelings that Hawthorne so amazingly expressed. These ideas far outweigh the verboseness. And I actually must admit that I did not find it an extremely long book. If you focus on the reading, it doesn't take long at all (compared to many longer novels of the same class).My advice: Wait until the right time. I tried to read it three times before, and never really got very far. Finally, this summer, I was able to enjoy it immensely. If you are not looking forward to reading it now, then just wait a little longer."
B0006EX1ZG,The marriage builder: A blueprint for couples and counselors : now with discussion guide for couples,,A25AMBAAZLNTQT,"Robert W. Kellemen ""Doc. K.""",11/12,5.0,1125532800,Soul Mates: Becoming Your Spouse's Spiritual Friend,"""The Marriage Builder"" by Dr. Larry Crabb has become something of a classic in the genre of Christian books on husband-wife relationships. In it, Crabb highlights three relational areas: the couple's spiritual relationship to God, their social/soul relationship to one another, and their physical relationship to each other. When dealt with properly, and in priority order, Crabb asserts that relationships will be healthy (not necessarily happy, since that is not God's goal nor guarantee for life this side of heaven).Discussing the spiritual relationship, Crabb explains that when God cleanses sin through salvation, His grace simultaneous quenches the deepest thirsts in the human soul. Rather than beings some new-age mantra as some claim when they critique Crabb, the concept of longings, desires, thirsts, and hunger is both biblical and historical (church history). The Trinitarian God of the Bible created humanity in His relational image. Since human beings are finite, they will always long for the infinite--for God's infinite holy love.Once a husband and wife have come to understand that all they need is God and what He chooses to provide, Crabb notes that then they can quit the old ""tic on a dog"" relationship of mutual manipulation. Instead, they can begin a relationship of mutual ministry.In this area, Crabb explores God's essential design for the masculine and feminine soul. He posits that males have a deep social longing for respect, which coincides with Paul's teaching in Ephesians 5. Crabb also explains that females have a deep social longing for intimacy, also correlating with Paul's teaching in Ephesians 5.As couples learn to drink fully from the God of the universe and to serve one another ""heapin' helpins'"" of respect and intimacy, then they are prepared to experience body oneness (not simply fun sex). One in their walk with God, one in their relationship with each other, now they move toward physical oneness.""The Marriage Builder"" is a classic because it remains true to God's classic teaching on relationships. We are spiritual beings designed to worship God; we are social beings designed to mutually minister to and intimately connect with one another; and we are physical beings, designed in the state of marital matrimony, to experience body oneness.Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of ""Soul Physicians,"" ""Spiritual Friends,"" and the forthcoming, ""Beyond the Suffering: The Story of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction."""
B000N6OVII,Brief History Of The Dead,,A1CHM200OEN65X,"Eric Wilson ""novelist""",2/2,3.0,1301184000,Rolling Marbles,"The title and cover alone were enough to sell me. I'd heard about the award-winning short story that served as the inspiration for this book, and then a friend told me what a great novel it was. The concepts of life, death, and the power of being remembered resonated with me, and I grabbed a copy, fully expecting to be swept away.The first chapter, the award-winning one, is imaginative, wise, and captivating. We learn of an in-between place where the dead live on with all the same aches and pains, waiting for that undetermined moment when they will pass on from this place to the unknown. They are not dumb. They soon realize that the ones who linger here are those who are still remembered on earth. They also realize that earth is being decimated by a virus, and as humans die, those caught in the in-between place move on, since they are no longer remembered by any one. Soon, the only ones left are those remembered by Laura Byrd.Laura is caught in Antarctica, part of a Coca Cola experiment that had her in seclusion and kept her safe from the devastating plague. She seems no more alive than those in the place she is headed, and we follow her solitary journey for survival not really sure why we should care. She has nothing to live for, and death doesn't seem to be an altering concept really. The heart of the book isn't really Laura or those still in her memory, but the concept of remembrance itself--and sadly, it's not explored with much feeling here.This city of the dead ones, who are in most ways still very much alive, is an interesting concept, and the author avoids swerving off into too many spiritual or religious alleyways. In some ways, this is a good thing. In other ways, it makes a huge and universal subject feel almost mundane. This should be a powerful book, or a thought-provoking one, but mostly it just plods along, like a string of short stories loosely connected. In a Chuck Palahniuk book, this would be bold and over the top, making the Coca Cola plot construct immaterial. Here, it seems ludicrous. In a Max Barry book, it might take on a satirical tone, full of humor. Here, the story lacks humor, avoids politics and religion, and--much like Laura's final moments--rolls along like marbles, simply following the terrain with no clear direction. The writing itself is clean and strong, and the author does give us some interesting concepts to consider. For that, it's worth giving a shot. I hoped for so much more, though. This is one short story that should've stayed that way. As a book, it's one I doubt I'll remember."

B000HH4MYQ,Catch-22,,AXRSKNDTK0WXP,E. L. Fay,1/1,5.0,1228435200,"""Deep-Seated Survival Anxieties""","When Joseph Heller's wonderfully hilarious novel ""Catch-22"" was published in 1961, World War II was celebrated as the ""good fight."" Popular memory held it as a noble stand against the Axis onslaught and a glorious victory for democracy, as opposed to the more recent Korean War, a somewhat muddled thing with no rousing cause beyond vague theories of ""containment."" Needless to say, many found the irreverence and dark humor of ""Catch-22"" somewhat disturbing. Its hero, Yossarian, spends the story trying frantically to be sent home and not fly any more missions, while the United States military is depicted as an inanely irrational bureaucracy. The multifaceted ""Catch-22"" tells many tales, including a contemporarily relevant account of rhetoric gone wrong and the wiles of words used justify a variety of dubious causes in ways that make nonsensical sense. The result is a highly entertaining dark comedy that takes absurdity to new heights.""Catch-22"" has often been described as the insanity of modern life as seen from the perspective of someone who is perhaps too sane. Yossarian is perturbed by the very logical fact that thousands of people whom he does not know nor has ever even met are trying desperately to kill him. Common sense would indicate that it is best to remove oneself from such a situation, especially given the basic biological instinct for survival found in all animals. However, such is the incongruous nature of war, here only heightened by the fantastically illogical organizations running it. In order for Yossarian to be properly discharged from service, he must be proven mentally unfit for combat. Unfortunately, the very act of self-preservation is indicative of a sound man. That, as Doc Daneeka explains, is the principle of Catch-22. Although he admits it has a ""spinning reasonableness"" and an ""elliptical precision about its perfect pairs and parts that was graceful and shocking,"" Yossarian remains steadfastly bound to the primordial value of life. It is later revealed that he came into his dangerously good sense after the gory death of his comrade Snowden in an air battle, thereby launching his quest to not fly any more missions. Alas, Colonel Cathcart, constantly trying to please his superiors so he can be promoted to general, persists in raising the number required. In essence, ""Catch-22 . . . says you've always got to do what your commanding officer tells you to.""I think Yossarian's plight is perhaps that the individual must always work to oppose the domineering ""vested interests"" of business, government, and the military. Though vital to modern world, these establishments are often forced to rely on unscrupulous means to safeguard themselves against a populace rightfully dissatisfied with them. The core definition of Catch-22, according an old woman, is that ""they have the right to do anything we can't stop them from doing."" Of course, so that they cannot be stopped, Yossarian's goal must be to prevent those in the military command from continuing to utilize him like a tool for their own ends. Yet the individual can never entirely escape the officious, overbearing, yet coldly and impersonally distant bureaucracies of contemporary society. To do so would be to violate the shifting facades of principle upon which they rest. There is too little to be certain of. Still, there remains the old declaration of skeptical philosophy: ""I think, therefore I am,"" as Descartes once phrased it. When the world takes on an air of unreality, when there is doubt of the very ground upon which one stands, there persists that one eternal verity: conscious life. Who wants a life, one character asks, if it is nothing but ""a series of unfortunate events""? The response is another question: ""What else is there?""When it was fist published in 1961, ""Catch-22"" received mixed reviews and moderate success. As the sixties continued on, however, Joseph Heller's novel took on a new significance. An entire generation was coming to question the authority under which they lived, as well as its rhetoric of black and white, good versus evil. Granted, there is little to have loved about the Communist dictatorship of the Soviet Union, although some American leftists came to believe that there was, but nor could the actions of the United States be seen as wholly in the right. President Lyndon B. Johnson subsequently found that he could not talk the public into supporting the Vietnam War with fuzzy affirmations of ""Courage, Might, Justice, Truth, Liberty, Love, Honor, and Patriotism"" backed by geopolitical jargon about the importance of the Third World in the liberty-or-death struggle against global Communism. In ""Catch-22,"" Yossarian finally decides to flee to Sweden: since the war is almost over, he would be risking his life for nothing but Colonel Cathcart's clamoring to be general. Meanwhile, in the real world, ""Yossarian Lives!"" would become a popular anti-Vietnam slogan. Escape was not an option for millions of young Americans in the late sixties who began to take ""Catch-22"" seriously and help make it into the classic it is today."

It's an autobiographical fiction: true on both counts. I believe Roth is a genius. I've read or seen the films of just about everything he's written. He makes me feel warm by addressing ideas that really matter and by bringing family stories alive. Little Philip is a noble, caring child, whose values stem from parents with commendable values. They take risks ; never flinch from helping others in perilous or pitiable situations. Of course, we also hear the other side of Philip's thinking; sometimes he is disgusted by the people he knows he must help, but this doesn't stop him. I loved the way he puzzled over enigmas: people and situations he didn't - couldn't - possibly understand. And this book shows us how wild his imagination was right from the start. He was born to be a writer; to tell stories. His sentences: marvels of construction. I love following them to their exhilerating conclusions. Bravo, Mr. Roth. You did it again!

DeWitt ""Alaska Fan""",3/3,5.0,1292025600,"Cunning, Lust and Greed","How did a small bands of Spanish conquistadors defeat the numerically vastly superior Amerind forces in the Aztec empire and the Inca empire? Innes offers a carefully documented, highly readable explanation of the very different characters of Cortes and Pizarro. It's a fascinating read.Cortes was an educated minor nobleman, whose letters back to Spanish King Charles offer one source for Innes. Cortes defeated the Aztecs by allying himself with unhappy neighbors, and considerable canny political intrigue. When the Aztec leader Monteczuma was killed and Cortes driven out of what is modern-day Mexico City, Cortes promptly fought his way back to power. Cortes may have been brutal, but there is something there to admire in his tactics, if not his world view.Pizarro, by contrast, was an uneducated, illiterate thug, who lucked into an Incan civil war and was able to seize the person of the Incan emperor Atahualpa, by betrayal. He accepted Atahualpa's offer to ransom himself for the famous room full of gold, but betrayed Atahualpa again and had him executed. I was unable to find a single promise that Pizarro made and actually kept.My only criticism of Innes' excellent effort is that he is just a shade too apologetic for the Conquistadore mentality. He is at pains to establish its roots in the end of the Spanish effort to defeat the Moors. But unbridled greed is still unbridled greed, and the picture that Innes paints is incredible.If you want to understand Latin and South America today, I think you must read this book."
B0007DRIVY,The other America;: Poverty in the United States (A Pelican book),,ALR35EFI69S5R,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""",73/76,5.0,981244800,America's Primer on the Existence of the Underclass!,"Few works of contemporary non-fiction have had more lasting impact on the social consciousness of the overall society from which it arose than ""The Other America"", Michael Harrington's now classic tome on the egregious conditions under which what we would now call the ""underclass"" lived in mid-20th century American society. With an uncommon verve and uncanny precision, Harrington painstakingly detailed the disgusting and shocking realities of life for those many millions of Americans of both color and ethnicity living lives of desperate poverty in the midst of the affluent society. Millions of readers, myself included, were shocked to discover the extent to which this world coexisted with our own, and many of the social action programs that arose in the 1960s and thereafter used this book as a kind of reference guide to the realities of poverty in contemporary society. Indeed, what is most disturbing about anyone re-reading the book is the discovery of how little conditions have changed for those who through the accident of birth, color, and ethnic origin, find themselves inexorably trapped in the vicious cycle of poverty.Sadly, for all the glad-handing of politicians and the proclamations by global corporations of the new and more widespread prosperity of the 1990s, the sobering truth is that very little progress has been made. Indeed, in more recent books such as William Finnegan's excellent ""Cold New World"", Harrington's basic thesis of the co-existence of a starker, poorer, and powerless populace left stranded to live lives of quiet desperation is reconfirmed, putting the lie to the many proclamations of universal opportunity and promise that politicians now ballyhoo. The book, which was first published in the early 1960s, was required reading for most introductory sociology and contemporary history courses, and millions of young academics first learned of the extent of the national problem through a reading of this book. It is, in that sense at least, a modern classic. Harrington's basic thesis is incontrovertible; poverty is extensive and endemic, and is usually hidden from the view of most affluent Americans due to the ways in which the two subcultures coexist in modern society. Through the de-facto residential segregation of the two elements of the society, there is little meaningful contact, and the media tends to ignore the facts of the existence of the underclass, portraying arch-types which conform more to the sensibilities of the more affluent segments of the society that regularly view its programming and enforcing unrealistic images of what exists. As a previous reviewer commented, we no longer habituate the same environments, and we tend to avoid all unnecessary contact with anything to do with this other world of poverty and want. What Harrington originally described in such anguished and inflammatory terms, hoping to purposefully ignite America's slumbering conscience, has instead become a permanent feature of our conscienceless socio-cultural landscape.It is a sad truth that Harrington's book is as timely and as shocking today as it was some forty years ago. His account of the fate of millions of impoverished people of color and ethnicity remains as cogent and as relevant as it was then. Despite the long and tortured history of the social legislation that attempted to rework this problem in the decades since, the reality of the situation seems to be that nothing much has changed in terms of the life-chances and hopes of the members of the underclass. It remains a mainstay of introductory courses in social stratification, providing an excellent overview of the myriad of the sociological, political, and economic issues surrounding the underclass, and is a wonderful example of just how important one man's vision of the truth can be in orienting others meaningfully toward rectifying a social problem. Poverty may remain, as they say, always with us, but the shocking truths found in this book still sheds the light of day into an unappetizing aspect of contemporary society we all should be aware of."

Re reading it again as an adult - I don't know, maybe one has to be a certain age..this time around I was deeply affected by the melancholy and spirit in the book. It is a novel of heart felt camaderie, of young men who strive to do their duty, then begin to question the root of their suffering and sacrifice. In the simple words of a soldier, the question is asked - why? Why all these mortal wounds, this wrenching parting from family, this utterly displaced and decimated generation - why are we asked to do this, and why do we not resist? The voice is of a quiet and reflective young man from a poor family who has enlisted at the urging of his teachers and is trying to stay alive through the horrors of trench warfare.Other writers have written sad/funny accounts of military training, and of war. But no one else has yet (in my opinion) matched Remarque for the immediacy of the portrait he draws, the subtle humor, the deep yet understated sorrow. This soldier's impatience with the civilians while on home leave, his bond with his ailing mother, his need for quiet and silence- all are brilliantly written. He demonstrates how life and death are a virtual game of chance in a soldier's life, in face of which idealism is long gone. Written from a young German soldiers point of view, it has considerably reduced the knot of suspicion I have carried in my heart about the ""axis"" for over 3 decades. I hope this is required reading for all recruits - and later, for generals alike."

It is unfortunate that he did not write straight history because the strongest part of his books is usually the narrative of what the soldiers actually went through -- the amount of marching and getting by on short rations greatly exceeds the time in combat. The one historical weakness of both this book and Arundel is that Benedict Arnold comes across as too heroic. As much time as Roberts spends on Arnold's frustrations and mistreatment by the Continental Congress, his portrayal of Arnold is of someone too good to betray his character. I also agree with the reviewer who tired of Cap's comic adventures. Still, Roberts has a strong narrative gift, and it is good to see his books back into print again. The N.C. Wyeth cover is also nice."

The first time was as a youth a very long time ago and it had a positive impact on me. I decided to reread it and see what additional insights it would bring into my life. It was clearly worth the few hours of my time it took to read this book. The device Lewis uses is very clever and forces one to look at sin, pride, and mediocrity from a totally different viewpoint. It becomes clear that it's not the big mistakes we make in life that really hurts us; sometimes those are the things that cause us to reevaluate our lives and repent. The things that really hurt us are the pride and the accumulation of little sins. Lewis seem to really be pushing for greatness of soul. Bottom line is this little book made me think about my life. That is what a good book should do.The book also includes the essay, ""Screwtape Proposes a Toast"". This was written much later and instead of Screwtape writing letters advising Wormwood, he is at an awards ceremony at the school for tempters proposing a toast to future and past successes. It is basically a vehicle to complain about how the modern education system focuses on mediocrity. It also brings out some very good points to ponder.I highly recommend this book to everyone. The principles espoused here apply to all people, religious or not."

Julia Scheeres told her story without anger or bitterness which, to me, is astonishing and it appears that she still has a relationship with her family after all that they did to her and her adopted brothers. I believe, as another reviewer does, that Escuela Caribe reform school should be investigated then closed so that other children are not subjected to abuse at the hands of these people. I am happy to see that Julia emerged from this horrifying childhood with her mental faculties intact and has done so much with her life. The book is a tribute to her love for her adopted brother, David, which is what ultimately kept her alive and sane. I highly recommend this book and will recommend it to my reading group."

Lovitt ""starmoth""",2/2,4.0,1133222400,Good overview of forensic methodology,"This is a 'how to' book: how to secure a crime scene; how to collect fingerprints (and feet, lip, and ear prints); how to identify blood splatter patterns, etc. It's not quite detailed enough to be considered a text book, unless the teacher uses supplementary material, but it is packed full of real-life examples, which is why I read it.This book is divided into five sections:""The Scene of the Crime""--some crime scenes are impossible for the first responder to completely protect, e.g. the Alfred P. Murrah Building in Oklahoma City after it had been bombed. For one thing, people had to be rescued from the ruins. Some of the more interesting examples in this book involve the movement of evidence off of the scene, e.g. a bullet that passed through a victim and lodged in a passing bicycle.I was also interested to discover that many states employ 'civilian' forensic technicians (it's cheaper than paying for another police officer). The swab-wielding cop is slowly fading from the American crime scene.""Working the Scene: the Evidence""--One of the best prints from a nightmarish crime scene came from a Christmas chocolate. Evidently the murderer didn't like nuts and put the chocolate back into the box, along with a beautiful print of his thumb.Criminals who stage crime scenes are often the easiest ones to catch. One man murdered three people, then dressed up in a gorilla costume and wrecked the house, just the way he imagined an enraged gorilla would have wrecked it, including a swing from the ceiling fan that ripped it to the floor.At first, the ident officer, Patricia McGuire was puzzled by the print of a four-inch finger tip. After the murder scene was thoroughly analyzed, it became obvious to her forensic team that it had been staged. They checked with the local costume shop, found out who had recently rented a gorilla suit, and arrested him for murder.""Working the Scene of the Body Human""-- One of the most surprising items in this section is how little DNA is still extracted and processed from crime scenes. Hopefully, as DNA becomes quicker and easier to process, it will become a major focus of a crime scene. One challenge of processing DNA from a crime scene is that it is so easy to contaminate the surroundings with the forensic team's DNA.Forensic Odontology is another fascinating tool. Be sure to check out the anecdote of the perp who bit himself in an effort to mislead the police.""Working the Scene: Different Stages""--A short section covering explosives and computers. Even as DNA can reveal a criminal's physical presence, so his computer can reveal the presence of his shoddy little mind, whether it be through pornographic photographs, bomb making instructions, or internet scams.""Working the Scene: Different Skills""--Another short section which includes the contributions of K-9 units and forensic photographers. Digital photography has actually made a criminalist's job harder because of the ease by which digital photographs can be altered.This book's numerous appendices delve into the qualifications needed, and types of jobs that are available to people who are interested in a career in forensics. ""The Forensic Casebook"" is a good overview for future criminal investigators, and could also be considered supplemental reading for TV 'true crime' fans (Hint: Columbo and the various CSI programs really take a beating for their sloppy investigative work)."

I found it truly an inspiration and it has changed the way my family eats dinner and communicates. In the book &quot;Table Talk&quot; the &quot;Once A Month Cooking&quot; book was referred to. For a year I've looked for it in various bookstores and it wasn't until I became a customer of Amazon.com that I found it. A month ago I ordered this book.

I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to put nutritious delicious meals on the table night after night with far less stress. This book is especially helpful for me because it allows me to prepare meals at a time of my choosing, when *I* have the energy to spend doing it, not when I have to pull something together after a tiring and busy day.

There facing the predatory sniffers, the antagonistic Patrol and the laser guns of the Thieves Guild, Murdoc must seek the source of the Zero stone and bargain for his rights to pursue his destiny as a free man.""The Zero Stone (1968) is the first novel in the two book Murdoc Jern series. Murdoc is the son of Hywel Jern, a former prime assessor to a sector boss of the Thieves' Guild. Hywel migrated to Angkor and married the daughter of a local hock-lock operator. Shortly after the marriage, his in-laws. and many others in the vicinity of the port, died from disease brought by a plague ship, but Hywel and his wife survived and even performed some of the necessary governmental functions during the emergency. Some five years later, Angkor became a hub for interstellar trade in that sector and the Jern business thrived through Hywel's many off-world contacts, both legal and illegal, but he maintained a low profile, operating from the same modest hock-lock.One day, the first officer of a space liner brought in a ring with a dull stone that was found in interstellar space, far from any star, on the finger of a space suited corpse. The crude stone is plain and cloudy, but has a remarkable hardness. The stone gives an impression of great power to Hywel and Murdoc, but not to the rest of the family. Hywel is obsessed with the stone and arranges an apprenticeship for Murdoc with Vondar Ustle, a master gemologist who searches for new sources of precious stones, so that Murdoc can search for more information on the ring and stone. Hywel is well satisfied with his life as apprentice to Vondar and, when he returns for a visit, finds that he no longer fits into his family. One evening, Hywel stays home to conduct some business while the rest of the family goes to a party. Leaving the party earlier, Murdoc returns home to find his father tied to his chair, bloody and dead. Murdoc takes the ring and stone from its hiding place and leaves his home forever.In this novel, Murdoc and Vondar have come to Koonga City on Tanth searching for gems. They are dining in a taproom when the Green Robes, native priests, enter, spin their selection wheel to point between Murdoc and Vondar, and try to take both men. Murdoc kills one priest, fights his way clear, and then finds sanctuary with the priests of Noskald. These priests arrange for a Free Trader, the Vestris, to take Murdoc off-world. The crew treats him in a distant, but civil manner, but his only companion is the ship's cat, Valcyr. When the ship sets down on a primitive planet, Valcyr accompanies Murdoc as he explores the area. When Murdoc finds some bits of a curiously dull black substance that forms an extremely hard but fuzzy oval, Valcyr takes the largest specimen and starts to lick it. Murdoc tries to take it away from her, but gets clawed for his efforts. When a crewman tries to get the specimen, Valcyr runs off with it and hides. Murdoc and the crewman find her again, but she then swallows it.When they return to the ship, the Medico tests Valcyr and the specimens; he determines that the black ovals are alive at a low level as if hibernating and that Valcyr is now pregnant. Since there is a possibility that Valcyr is not carrying ordinary kittens, she is locked in a cage within the sick bay. About four weeks later, she disappears from the cage and is next seen in Murdoc's cabin with a newborn animal, Eet, that is not a kitten. And then Murdoc finds himself covered with purple blotches and feeling feverish. At this point, Murdoc and Eet leave the Vestris, Murdoc in a spacesuit and Eet in a clear-sided box, to escape the plague-fearing, frantic crew.This novel has some of the signature characteristics of the author's space adventure tales, including the outcast Murdoc, the telepathic Eet, and alien artifacts. The creature Eet is rather unique in the author's space adventures, having a human level of intelligence, yet possessing an animal body.Highly recommended for Andre Norton fansGunner, June, 2009"
B000K6KBDA,Starship Troopers,,,,0/0,5.0,866160000,Surely one of the all time Science Fiction classics,"This book is surely one of Heinlein's finest works. Publishedin 1959 it is still as fresh as the day it was written almost 40 yearsago. Over the past 25 years I must have read this book well over a dozen times, my enjoyment of it never deminishing. I can think of only one other book that compares and that is Joe Haldeman's ""The Forever War"". Both must surely be among the staples of any Science Fiction diet.The concerns of the day which may have fueled Heinlein's imagination are firmly (we hope ) behind us, yet this detracts nothing from the extremely good story telling, and above everything else Heinlein was a superb story teller. I won't relate any of the tale here, but simply say that if you have never read the book buy it and read it, you won't be dissapointed. If you have read it in the past but no longer have a copy, buy it and read it again. It is every bit as good as you remember it.Alan Russell"
0786224282,The Terrible Hours: The Man Behind the Greatest Submarine Rescue in History,,A1FU2AN0R39Z24,"Douglass T. Davidoff ""Doug""",29/30,4.0,945043200,"Unknown Til Now, But One of the Century's Best","Peter Maas gives us a tale that brings the heretofore unknown Swede Momsen to the forefront of the American heroic tradition. In describing how Momsen performs the first deep sea rescue of a marooned submarine crew, Maas tells a first-class tale. He describes how Momsen became one of the Navy's best officers, often not by blindly saying &quot;yes,&quot; but more often by challenging conventional wisdom and practicing relentless innovation -- even when it was not welcome or understood. He risked his life many times. The rescue of the crew of Squalus off the Isles of Shoals, New Hampshire, is enough of a story to merit a place for Momsen. But Maas proceeds to describe Momsen's entire naval career, which includes a hand in bringing about nuclear submarines and even a stint at solving the worst problem in the entire fleet -- namely, bringing order to the Navy's worldwide mail. Momsen has been dead for more than 30 years, but his life and work are a story about leadership, innovation, practical organization politics, and being personally effective. It's a great book, a real page-turner. The only drawback is an occasional spell of technical briefing which produced nothing more in me than a desire to skip a few pages and return to the spellbinding story of this man's life's work."

Haines,7/8,5.0,1076371200,Evolutionary logic,"The common view of deserts as &quot;barren&quot; places empty of life is firmly laid to rest by this excellent collection of essays. Alcock's relation demonstrates the wide variety and diversity of lifeforms found in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona. Plants, insects, birds and other animal life abound if you take the trouble to find them. The author is an expert at observing all this life. Better, he's adept at showing you how to follow in his footsteps to see what he sees.&quot;Footsteps&quot; is the significant term in this book. Not ATVs, aircraft, nor other vehicular means, but walking quietly is the method to employ in behold ing the desert. Alcock provides examples of his techniques in researching various aspects of life. Surprising wasps in their rituals requires finesse and timing. Seemingly, he moves directly from office to landscape - one of his marking tools being a bottle of Liquid Paper. With this &quot;paint&quot; he can identify individual insects - male wasps and butterflies seeking mates. This technique lapses with rattlesnakes and coyotes, however.More easily identified subjects are the palo verde trees and giant saguaro cactuses. His palo verde trees are numbered [in his memory], but the saguaros are often elusive. Not because these ancient, giant cacti are mobile, but because his urban neighbours see fit to use them for target practice. Many of his jaunts confront him with spent shells, pock-marked rocks and shattered giant cactus plants. Desert soil pockets, often the home of slumbering spade-foot toads are riven with vehicle tracks. Their passage disturbs the dormant toads who believe the noise presages water-delivering thunderstorms. Awakening, they emerge in the belief the water is signalling the time for courtship and reproduction. The disappointment is greater than simply mating deferred. It may mean the toad has expended its resources. It will dry out and expire.In describing how the details of desert life is seen today, Alcock muses on the roots of life's processes. Why do the Tarantula Wasp and the Great Purple Hairstreak butterfly [which displays nothing visible that's purple] evolve parallel mating rituals? How can some species successfully deal with the spines of the cholla cactus when a human stuck with the spines must endure a full day's pain? Why do some bees fly in solitude while others are flock in swarms? Alcock examines these and similar questions with sound evolutionary logic. He stresses that simple or apparent solutions often require re-examination. Horned lizards only take a few ants from a nest entrance. Are they &quot;prudent predators&quot; saving prey for later exploitation? Alcock reflects on possibilities to arrive at a solution Darwin would have admired. As do we.

I'll grudgingly give him that. However, I wonder exactly what his purpose was in writing the volume? He must have known it would take a beating for its inaccuracies, so he didn't write it for the academics or scholars. I can only conclude that he wrote it as popular history, that is, to entertain the general public. Just the same, though a more casual approach with more entertaining material is justified for a general readership, still these people deserve a book that at least attempts to be truthful. Did he have an agenda? I don't know but it seems so. He skims over some individuals and periods while devoting multiple pages to others. I can't tolerate historians who cover fascinating times so dully that even fellow history buffs can hardly stifle the snores. However, I am picky enough to want reasonable accuracy too.

0375727442,The Fatal Englishman: Three Short Lives,10.99,,,5/7,5.0,1073520000,Great Read,"This book is wonderful. I let my art professor borrow this book and she went out and bought a copy for herself. But, not before taking time before a lecture to thank me for introducing her to this work. Most people have never heard of these men but they are fascinating and tragic. One becomes an artist after being stricken with polio. He displays talent and Picasso and Cocteau praise him. He works frantically but becomes frustrated and perhaps displays symptons of schizophrenia. His very death is a mystery, maybe he was pushed or jumped in front of an oncoming train. The second is different from the other two by his arrogance and personality. He is a pilot during WWII. Soon, he becomes the last surviving pilot of his outfit and against warnings and advice flies again, crashes and dies. He was horribly burned in a previous plane crash, which kept him from flying for a while, that changes everything for him. That's a given but he was a big flirt and used to getting women easily charmed. He even had an affair with a Hollywood movie actress. She starred opposite of Laurence Olivier in Wuthering Heights-Merle Oberon. The third and final man in this book is to me the most tragic. He is a man of complete brillance and very bright in everything he does. He flies through school with humor, charm, and by his intelligence. His teachers complain that he breezes through his education far too easily but brillantly. His sexuality poses a problem at a time when it was outlawed in Britain. His father is a sort of senator who loves his son, but there is conflict because of this law. He falls into alcoholism perhaps because of boredom. Even though intelligent in all subjects he has no one outstanding favorite subject, let's say. He becomes a journalist and gets tangled with the KGB and British intelligence and eventually CIA. At a certain point, he marries, which surprises all his friends, and talks of having children but dies mysteriously. The woman he married, he used to associate with in Russia during his stay as a reporter. Faulks engages you with his research and facts and doesn't really elaborate and digress. So, the life story of each man doesn't become murky unless he is going over a murky period of the men's lives. Each biography is told separately and like an essay comes together satisfactorily in the end. A sort of guilt comes over while reading and looking at the pictures though. It's as if someone could have tried harder for each or it makes you think about people in your life and wonder about them. Very good but I didn't like Faulk's book Birdsong. Mentioning that because I bought it after adoring this book."

I have noticed that the end of Burke's books is not consistent with the books themselves. He does not &quot;build&quot; to the ending, and therefore, the ending is a disappointment.The main character in the book is a person called &quot;Legion&quot;. He is 74 years old, but he gives Dave Robicheaux a fierce whipping and he shames him. Legion is one eerie character and Dave, surprisingly, is scared of him.Two women are murdered (one after the other) and the primarysuspect is Tee Bobby Hulin, described as a &quot;twenty-five year old black hustler...&quot; One of the murdered women is the daughter of a &quot;button&quot; man, Joe Zeroski, who comes to town with the murderous rage. Joe brings his gang to town, including his niece who has an relationship with Clete Purcell. Clete, in the meantime, has an affair with the woman who is Assistant District Attorney. Robicheaux, with the help of a partner, solves the mystery - but he cannot get Legion out of his mind.James Lee Burke is a reflective person. His characters are often violent - but they show a surprising gentleness. I always enjoy Burke's books because they show me a side to him that I had not known."

Janos III,2/2,5.0,982540800,Good Ideas Without Money Behind Them Are Worthless!!,"The authors did a fine job writing about the need for every one to educate themselves on the means to acquire wealth. Good ideas without money behind them end up worthless. This book is a very good idea and Jesse Jackson and Juliette Fairley deserve all the kudos anyone can muster.The book explains in detail and by example how you first must understand the means to wealth and then practice discipline to acquire it! It is not matter of luck but culture and lack of knowing the opportunities that exist. When Wharton graduates become parents, financial matters are discussed at the dinner table. Contacts are maintain through friendship and networking. Opportunities are created from such encounters and knowledge of how the system of investment works.Yet, we from the middle class use to discuss the football players not how the owners invested into the teams. The underclass of all colors are more disadvantaged. Thus, the authors can show you how to think of sports as a monopoly to be acquired instead of illusion of fan ownership with misplaced devoted loyalty. The difference is cleverly hidden. The fan wastes his time watching sports and spending his money to attend the games. As the investors who own the sports are making the money as they watch to boot. One must stop watching and start learning to invest is the moral of the story.The authors point out nothing is not out or reach, if you acquire the education to invest on what you love to do and this book is the place to start. Jesse Jackson often gets criticized for putting his nose in places he feels are causes for change. Whatever your opinion of him, you can't deny he has not helped many people in many ways and this book is just an example of one of them.Jesse is human like any of us and can fall from grace anytime and has had the courage to admit it. At the same time, he won't stay down for long and he desires what all leaders desire, a healthy economy for the benefit of all. Jesse Jackson is not the problem but part of the solution as evident by this book with Juliette Fairley.I came away from reading the book with knowing the color of green with portraits of dead presidents knows no discrimination. Money is sought after with over glorified admiration by the many towards the few. Yet, if one is interested in money instead of being just motivated to acquire it, you will come to understand the difference between the two. Being interested in money as a tool for change is an entirely different matter than being motivated by money in thinking it is the answer to all dreams, fame and power. The book shows how to use it as a tool, for the benefit of you and others.I highly recommend this book be purchased for anyone you feel is struggling to make ends meet in today's world of economic freedom or servitude depending upon your position and attitude. A book like this can change the lives of many."
0760726558,"I'm Retiring, Now What?!: Get Your Finances in Order/ Decide Where To Retire/ Healthy Living",,A1AYUZS87F0IYQ,George Fulmore,6/6,2.0,1037750400,"Wide-Ranging, but shallow effort","""I'm Retiring, Now What?"" is a book that appears to aimed at near-retirees who might feel that they are missing something before reading the book. And most folks will probably feel that they come away with at least one or two bits of new and useful information after reading it. The problem is that nearly every conceivable pre-retirement topic is hit in a two-page-limit format, one after another, with the assurance that the most basic information on each topic is included. The result is that there is information over and over again that you'd think would have been understood by the reader already. Some examples: ""...credit card bills on a fixed income can quickly become hazardous to your financial health."" ""To be eligible (for Social Security), you or your spouse need to have acquired 40 credits during our working years."" ""In 1997 a new kind of IRA was born: the Roth IRA."" ""Medicare is a health insurance program for people 65 or older.""Another negative on the book is that it consistently takes popular stands, almost as if it is the easy way out. For example, on long-term-care insurance, it states the common insurance industry statistic: ""...almost half of America's elderly citizens will spend time in some type of long term care."" Anybody who know where that statistic comes from knows that the industry continues to include people who go into a care facility for less than a year, knowing that that group, which is about half of the ""half"" in the statistic should be thrown out. A better number is that about 25% of those over 65 will spend more than a year in a facility.In several cases, the book pushes AARP membership, but is not convincing in its sales pitch, but gives the feeling that it is hopeful for the AARP endorsements because of the plugs. Another rub is some of the photos. For the section on Social Security, a guy pictured at the beginning of the section looks to be well into his 70's to me. With more than 60% of Americans now starting Social Security at age 62, this guy seems inappropriate for the book if it is, in fact, being written primarily for those on the verge of retirement. Other photos of folks who would appear to be well into their 70's or even 80's seem confusing to me, as they do not seem to be the target audience.In the financial areas, I also don't see the advice to spend down one's private savings before pulling from 401K's or IRA's, advice that is commonly given by other sources.In summary, while the book is a quick, harmless read, I don't feel that it is, in general, worth the effort. The layout, graphics and price .........should lead to good sales, but what's missing for me is any inspiration about the retirement concept itself. The work is obviously written by non-retired financial advisor types trying to hit all the bases, which produces just another looking-in-from-the-outside work for pre-retirees. I don't feel that it makes any serious impact to the body of books having been written on the subject of retirement to date."

Although he orders his study chronologically and includes quite a bit of biographical detail, this is not a book for gossip lovers. Instead, Scott dispassionately evaluates Callas' singing in general and major performances and roles in particular.Scott's basic thesis is that Callas reached her vocal peak early, in the first part of the 1950s, and her great weight loss was in large part responsible for a general vocal decline thereafter, at first slow, then precipitous after her divorce from Meneghini.At times his viewpoint provides a useful corrective to stories that have been handed down and repeated that are not exactly true--his take on the infamous Rome Norma of January 1958 is a striking example. His opinion that the root cause of many of the &quot;scandals&quot; that dogged her career was escalating vocal trouble certainly deserves serious consideration.On the other hand, Scott is too quick to dismiss much of Callas' work from the later 1950s. By then, the early, prodigious vocal endowment had somewhat diminished, true; but for most opera lovers these years were the time when her still responsive voice was matched with her most exquisite musicianship.Most readers will disagree, perhaps vehemently, with some of Scott's judgements and opinions; yet, by virtue of his firsthand witnessing of many of Callas' performances and determined avoidance of scandalmongering, his book joins a select company of work by Fitzgerald, Ardoin, Jellinek and a few others as one that sheds true light on the art of this much-discussed singer."

North of Havana is a little different because it is set in Cuba and the character dynamics are different. Tomlinson seems laregly insane and Dewey Nye (who accompanies Doc to Cuba against his wishes) does not seem to fit into this story very well. For some reason North of Havana bogs down a little.

0815702035,Keeping the Compound Republic: Essays on American Federalism,17.59,A2C5F4L00Y9XW9,Matthew P. Arsenault,3/5,4.0,1130025600,Evolution of American Federalism,"I gathered from Derthick's essays that American federalism, to a point, is a fluid institution. The battle between state's rights and federal authority is ongoing. Although the general trend is an increasing level of national supremacy, neither the state, nor the federal government has yet or will possess the power to secure a monopoly of control. I found most interesting the impact of the Supreme Court and the Progressive Era on changes in American federalism.In discussing the Supreme Court, it is necessary to point out that its impact has ebbed and flowed in regards to state's rights and federal authority. For example, under the Warren court, decisions were passed down which limited the right of individual states to govern their own affairs in a sovereign manner. The author cites a number of court decisions as illustrations of the imposition of federal will over state self-governance. Two famous cases are Miranda v. Arizona and Brown v. Board of Education. In both cases, the Court imposed a national will upon the decisions of the state.As stated above, the impact of the Supreme Court on federalism does not flow in one direction. Under the late William Rehnquist, the Supreme Court began to hand down decisions that placed a greater influence on the rights of states to govern their own affairs without the pressure of federal authority. Two important cases illustrating the general feeling towards federalism by the Rehnquist court are Brown v. Thomson, which dealt with state apportionment plans, and San Antonio v. Rodriguez, which dealt with equality between schools. In both cases, the Court found in favor of the states handling their own affairs without the influence of federal authority.A second impact on the fluid nature of American federalism was the Progressive Era. Derthick writes, ""The Progressive Era advanced a new way of thinking about federalism, grounded less in constitutional law than in conceptions of community and political ideology"" (106). I found this interesting due to the attack on the Constitution. Rather than adhere to a literal reading of the Constitution, Progressives argued for interpretation of the words of the founding fathers. The Constitution held that the United States was ""an indestructible Union composed, of indestructible States"" (106).The Progressives, however, attempted to create a national community rather than one separated by state boarders. In order to do so, the Progressives launched a movement which offered a new interpretation of the Constitution, rather than a strict reading. This interpretation focused on the importance of a national consensus. The good of the nation, should surpass the individual desires of those in a particular state. J. Allen Smith, quoted in Derthick writes, ""A constitution can not be regarded as a check upon the people themselves...(but) the means of securing the supremacy of public opinion and not an instrument of thwarting it...(the Constitution) must yield readily to changes in public opinion"" (108).Although the Supreme Court and the Progressive Era are not the only sculptors of American federalism, their impact cannot be ignored. The interactions between the two, and among each's subsequent part, the fluidity and malleability of the American federal system becomes apparent."
B0007OXTJI,The Burden of Bad Ideas: How Modern Intellectuals Misshape Our Society,,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,Jeffrey Leach,64/86,5.0,1037232000,"Heather MacDonald, Apostle of Sanity","Of all the social critics lamenting the conditions of the welfare state-- such as Thomas Sowell, Michelle Malkin, Martin Gross, and Dinesh D'Souza-- it is Heather MacDonald who burns the brightest. This slim book, ""The Burden of Bad Ideas,"" is an erudite and scathing assault on all of the leftist sacred cows currently stampeding through our society. The picture of a giant lemon on the cover sets the tone right from the start. The book is a collection of essays MacDonald wrote for something called the ""City Journal,"" a New York publication concerning urban affairs and related issues.What is so impressive about MacDonald's detailed expositions is her coverage of topics that do not appear often in other publications or books. MacDonald examines, by turns, the corrosive effect of leftist foundations on society, the elevation of poverty into sainthood, education colleges and their bubble head curriculum, the Smithsonian Institution's rabid devotion to identity politics and white guilt, the wackos inhabiting some of our elite law schools, the Amadou Diallo farce, and several other important topics ignored by our supposedly unbiased media systems. Several of the essays were so depressing I had to lie down and rest after reading them.Even when MacDonald covers a familiar topic she does so from a different perspective, uncovering infinite layers of chicanery from those lovable leftists. For example, a discussion about the sorry state of our schools finds MacDonald analyzing the merits of a special school in New York that teaches ghetto culture as a serious academic discipline. Students learn how to improve their graffiti skills through in class study sessions. Whether these students eventually break the law by applying what they learn in real life situations is not the point; they are ""artists"" who aren't allowed to ""express"" themselves by the larger society. It is garbage, of course, and MacDonald pulls no punches revealing the warped minds behind the madness, minds devoted to racial hate of whites, derision towards western culture, and a total disregard for the concepts of private property and law. These three warped concepts emerge again and again in MacDonald's essays.The essays are timeless, showing the progression of leftist ideas through both time and space. An essay on the ""Hundred Neediest Cases"" best expresses this point. In 1913, The New York Times began a run of Christmastime articles about the worst cases of poverty in the city. The emphasis at this time was on people in true need, those who worked hard but fell on bad times due to circumstances beyond their control. MacDonald follows the series through time, showing how leftist ideas about poverty began to dominate the series. By the 1960's, poverty cases no longer spent much time discussing the poor orphan or widowed mother. Instead, dope users, teen mothers, and other assorted losers lacking any concept of personal responsibility took the spotlight. Grousing about lack of funds for the poor began to appear, as did politically correct ideas about the nature of poverty. This essay alone proves, beyond any doubt, the rapid decline of our values and our country.Bureaucracy is often found at the bottom of the leftist agenda. Safely ensconced in their cubicles beyond the reach of the voter, bureaucrats are the shock troops of leftist ideology. Bureaucrats constantly create new ""services"" to remedy problems created by previous ""services."" It is a never-ending cycle, and one that creates more dependency, more drug and alcohol addiction, more unwanted children, and more taxes for those who live responsibly. Regrettably, MacDonald makes the mistake here that many social critics make, namely that changing administrations will solve the problems. The bureaucracy is here to stay, folks. Only a revolution will produce the sweeping changes needed to reverse the odious problems ailing our society.The essays in this book are brilliant. ""The Burden of Bad Ideas"" is still available, just in time to stuff your favorite leftist's Christmas stocking. MacDonald has a new book coming out soon, and if it is anywhere near as brilliant as this book MacDonald will soon appear on a news channel near you."

Kunkle,9/9,5.0,1145664000,"Finally, Clear Thinking for Youth on Tough Issues","If you do a quick survey of the books available to young people dealing with moral issues, you will discover two things. First, there aren't very many out there and secondly, they aren't very substantive. Indeed, we often tell our young people to ""just say no"" and that is about the extent of our moral training for students. Enter McDowell's book.The structure of McDowell's book is well thought out. Chapter one kicks the discussion off by making a case for why a student's moral life is one of the most important things he or she can think about. Chapter 2 reminds students it is not a matter of personal will power but rather, the power of God's Spirit. Chapters 3 and 4 lay a necessary foundation for morality by examining the idea of truth and showing the flaws in relativism. After building a framework for moral thinking, McDowell is ready to address individual moral issues, which he does in the remaning chapters with more breadth and depth than most young people have ever encountered. Students won't find a ""God says it, I believe, that settles it"" rationale here! Instead, they'll find a thoughtful, careful, reasonable, and biblical case for particualar moral views.As one who works with thousands of students every year, I cannot recommend McDowell's book enough. I hope this is the beginning of more thoughtful and substantive resources for young people, who are eager for as much."

Her beloved husband Jack, a trans-Atlantic pilot, and Kathryn have shared a strong relationship over the years they have been together. Her happy family lifestyle explodes into pieces when Jack's plane blows up while in the air ten miles from Ireland, then she discovers bit by bit how little she knew Jack Lyons. First, she faces a media frenzy when the flight recorder makes clear that Jack was carrying a bomb in his flight bag. Her illusions of a her so-called good marriage crumble, despite her belief in the love she and Jack had and the need to keep Jack's memory pure for teenage daughter Mattie. As she navigates the dark days with the priest-like assistance of Robert, the pilot union's grievance expert, Kathryn increasingly feels compelled to come to grips with Jack's hidden life. Following up on a phone number she discovers among his papers, she and Robert go to London, where she finds Jack's other family: Muire, an unrepentant Irish beauty and former flight attendant, and her two young children. By now the plot is fairly screaming IRA bombers! but instead of guns and M15 surveillance teams we get Kathryn's long, sad walk in the rain and an attempt at consolation by a now-doting Robert. The next morning, Kathryn, still lagging two beats behind the reader, has the whole thing explained to her at breakfast by a remorseful Muire, who's now forced to go on the run. Already struggling with grief, Kathryn is stunned by the incessant questions about Jack, their marriage, and even Mattie's personal life. Rumors abound that Jack lived a secret life. Soon the media accuses Jack of pilot error and the flight investigators believe he committed suicide. After finding some inexplicable notes in their home, Kathryn is unable to sit idle as her past and her spouse seem to have their history rewritten so she begins her own inquiries. As she searches into Jack's past with the help of union official Robert Hart, Kathryn wonders exactly who her husband truly was? Kathryn is an interesting character struggling with what she learns about the husband she never knew. Robert adds little to the plot beyond informing the widow of the tragedy. He adds an unnecessary betrayal and romantic subplot that takes the audience on a inclement weather detour. Their teenage daughter Mattie is intelligent and loving though a bit too independent as fifteen-year old girls seem to be, at least with their moms. I recommend this book for anyone that is interested in reading about a story that keeps you wondering what is going to happen next. This book kept me wondering the whole time, what the next step or event that was going to happen."

I'll give it a bit for having good description in a few places, but only a miniscule few.But that isn't even the reason for this rating. What I found most unpleasantly apalling was the content of this so-called classic. It completely and utterly disappointed me in its horrific plot that I wouldn't even care to mention. Am I a happy-go-lucky reader? No; In fact, I quite often enjoy the sad and angry scenes in many novels, but an element of this one that I still can't quite name and don't care to that made those scenes so obtuse. This book should be completely wiped off and eradicated from the lists of classics to read and analyze in schools."

When I picked it up at my local library, I gritted my teeth, expecting to be eviscerated by a bitter cynic. Instead, what I found was a thoughtfully written piece about growing up and the influences that shape our world view. I graduated from Keswick while Christine was attending elementary school, but the biggest grin was her reference to the guys by the pickup truck with the Ayatollah sign. All those guys were my friends from my graduating class (we were seniors that year) - and I can tell you that all of them grew up - like Christine - as free thinking, contributing members of society. I guess that having a firm foundation in the bible isn't a bad place to begin your education.The only puzzling but necessary part of the book were the name changes of the teachers and students. I was able to identify most of the people she referenced by her descriptions, including the principal and head master, but it did make for some puzzling reading at first.My experience at Keswick was ""mixed"" as well, with some pretty horrific experiences, like being banned from the library and the bus my last two years at school, but also positive, like meeting my future wife and having a very weird and memorable time at school. Having boundaries is an important part of growing up - and Keswick certainly created those! What fun is it to misbehave if you don't get in trouble?Christine puts the ""FUN"" back into FUNdamental education. So, as a fellow Keswickian married to another Keswickian - thank you."

B000GQXSY8,Gone with the Wind,,A2JBML3I9KVLC9,"""rgittle""",4/4,5.0,1021507200,Gone With the Wind,"Gone With the Wind is a classic novel of love and loss. Taking place in a time and place which is, quite literally, &quot;gone with the wind,&quot; it is interesting in both a historical sense and a romantic one. This novel is often called &quot;the greatest love story of all time,&quot; and truthfully at that. There is nothing quite as stirring as the interactions between Rhett and Scarlett. Margaret Mitchell's classic writing and understanding of times gone by makes this one of my (and the world's) ultimate favorites. At this point, this novel has reached so much fame that it is hardly necessary to discuss the plot, but for those uninformed out there, here it is:Scarlett O'Hara is the beautiful and headstrong eldest daughter of rich, high class plantation owners living just south of Atlanta during the antebellum period. Scarlett is the belle of the county - she has the smallest waist, the prettiest face, and the flirtiest personality. She could have any man, except the one she wants - Ashley Wilkes, who is already engaged to the frail but very sweet Melanie. When the Civil War breaks out everything changes. Scarlett marries, but is immediatly made a widow, and she moves to Atlanta to stay with Melanie. All the while Rhett Butler is lurking around. He's handsome, suave, and has a horrible reputation - hardly the kind of gentleman Scarlett was raised to like. But Scarlett, with her stubborn, headstrong attitude, brains, and independence is hardly a typical southern lady. As the war rages on, Scarlett's world is shattered and challenged. Wealth turns to poverty, pride to despair, admiration to dislike, and hate to love.Once started, this is a novel that cannot be put down. Many people read the whole thing (over 1,000 pages) in one very long sitting! That's what I did."
078123395X,Princess Casamassima (volume 5 & 6) (Notable American Authors),150.0,A2PR6NXG0PA3KY,Giordano Bruno,3/3,5.0,1240358400,Revolutionaries? Henry James? You gotta be kidding!,"Class conflict, in smudgy smug old London where only glimmers of social turmoil waft across the Channel from France and Germany, is ostentatiously the framework though perhaps not tout &aacute; fait sub sigillo the subject of this odd early novel by Henry (America's finest French novelist) James. It all begins in the drab and dingy parlor of a dressmaker's shop in a squalid alley of sub-hygienic London, a scene seemingly transliterated from Dickens's 'Hard Times' or Mrs. Gaskell's 'North and South.' The characters - Pinnie the dressmaker, Mrs. Bowerbank the women's prison warden, old Vetch the theater pit fiddler - are prime Dickens, nay, better than prime Dickens in their plausible caricature. Have no fear, however! Such picturesque ale-and kidney-pie descriptiveness lasts only a few chapters before the narrative sublimates into James's usual cirro-stratus ambiguity and indirection. From that point on, if you choose to treat ""The Princess Casamassima"" as a mystery novel (and that is as apt a way to treat it as any I could recommend), you'll find it delightfully challenging to formulate any expectations of an outcome or, indeed, to maintain any modest supposition that you grasp what the devil it's really all about.Henry James knew as much, first hand, about the lower classes as I know about camel-breeding. What did Henry James know about, except himself? The man was an exile from normal life as well as from America, a hermetic psychological hermit who dined in and on society 180 days a year. He must have been extraordinarily adept at absorbing impressions from casual conversation. Above all, he was at leisure, and his working-class characters in this novel seem implausible only in their leisurely traversal of time and space. James requires leisure of his readers also. This is a long, diffuse, leisurely novel, and an extremely entertaining one, once you acknowledge its demands: a comfortable armchair, an expanse of idleness, a tolerance for vagaries and syntactical meanderings. There's very little in it that will match the worldview of a 21st Century reader, but then I doubt many readers of 1886 failed to discover that Mr. James was an odd duck. Only when you grasp that unique oddness, when you acknowledge how every item of The Princess Casamassima is cast in an interior fantasy, a kind of science fiction of the sentiments, will you begin to appreciate what a masterpiece this novel is! But you'll need to be as leisurely as the author.The focal character, Hyacinth Robinson, is essentially a 'changeling' in the long European tradition of literary fairy princes. He's the son of a French prostitute and an English lord whom his mother murdered. Raised in abject poverty and lacking any opportunities for 'improvement', he nonetheless has exquisite finesse, an intrinsic gentility, a keen intelligence. One assumes, on literary precedent, that in the end he will come into his own and get his princess. That was surely what James expected us to assume, n'est pas? and the sly subversion of those assumptions will be part of the fun. The Princess, whose title and whose support come from her estranged Italian husband, can't fail to remind us of fairy tale prototypes also -- ineffably beautiful and ethereal, perversely willful, fond of posing riddles, as it were, of which her own motivation is the deepest riddle of all. And there's the buxom ""daughter of the city"" - Millicent - whom James portrays with a certain air of hankering after such a one. Do NOT, however, expect the minorest mention of explicit sexuality in James, even when the entire tissue of emotional probability depends on it! Biographers have speculated ad nauseam about James's sexual identity; the consensus seems to be that he had none, and yet Hyacinth's attentions to his Princess and his childhood playmate Millicent are redolent with concupiscence.It's interesting to compare this novel about 'revolutionaries' with the two novels by Joseph Conrad about the same milieu, ""The Secret Agent"" and ""Under Western Eyes."" James had a significant influence on Conrad. People who find one hard to read, usually because of discomfort with elaborate syntax, generally resist the other as well. Conrad was closer to events, far more a man of the whole world, a far more prophetic writer, and his conclusions were far less reactionary, but James was unmatched in his penetration into the human psyche, even when the only psyche he probed was his own. My advice? Don't deprive yourself of either Conrad or James! Find that armchair and let the language flow!"
0670853453,Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha,,ASOJUBRHQI1DW,IRA Ross,3/3,5.0,1005782400,Recapturing Childhood,"Roddy Doyle's _Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha_ realistically and poignantly captures the nature of childhood in a manner probably unlike any novel ever previously written. Unlike Holden Caulfield, who is a frightened and disturbed adolescent severely out of touch with the world around him, Paddy Clarke is very much a typical 10 year old boy growing up within a very normal environment and circumstances. His family--his ma, his da, and his younger brother, Sinbad--are also quite ordinary. That Paddy spends his childhood in Ireland is incidental to the novel. Paddy's experiences and feelings are universal to young boys throughout the world.We enter the world of Paddy and his friends in the classroom and at play. With every situations filtered through Paddy's eyes, we can experience his pain, his joy, his fears, and his triumphs and disappointments from his perspective. Instead of a linear plot development, Paddy tells his story in terms of incidents in his life. His narrative is disjointed, very much the way a young boy would necessarily relate such a personal tale to others. Because of its realness, Paddy's tale is never less than engaging and heartfelt.Recalling my own childhood, I was particularly amazed at how accurately portrayed were Paddy's reactions to the conflicts and attitudes of the adults around him, especially those of his parents. Being a child, Paddy lives in a different world from his parents. A constant outsider, he desperately tries to gauge whether his parents have been arguing, whether his mother has previously been crying, or even if his parents were on the verge of breaking up. Also, like most children, Paddy has an active fantasy life. We share in Paddy's imaginings about death--an animal's, those of individual family members, and even his own. Particularly affecting is the author's depiction of Paddy's dealing with the universal conundrum of love and hate. Paddy learns that one is not necessarily mutually exclusively of the other, and that he can feel both love and hate at the same time, especially for his little brother."

The archaeologist, John Kenton, falls madly in love with a priestess of Ishtar named Sharane aboard ship, but prompts the bitter wrath of a priest of Nergal. Kenton has many adventures while on the ship, but keeps being pulled back to Earth at unpredictable moments. After one such trip, Kenton returns to the ship only to find that Sharane has been kidnapped; so with the aid of some friends, he sets off to rescue her.A bare description of the plot may not do the book justice, as the story is densely constructed with mythological layers and a very florid style of writing that is very evocative (though it is overdone at points and slows the story to a crawl). Characters are very one-dimensional, dialogue is decent, and there's some zesty description in the action scenes. Although perhaps overlong, The Ship of Ishtar has enough interesting features to recommend it. It's one of those books that fits into the fantasy genre, but is so different than most fantasy that it creates a memorable contrast."

B000GNVAW8,The Stranger,,A1CTZB80ZEVY62,John Cummings,5/7,5.0,982022400,The Stranger-Exestentialism in Circulation,"In a beautiful blend of contrasting elements and brilliant integration of circular symbolism, Albert Camus paints a picture of life and human nature in his existentialist novel The Stranger. This story is that of an impassive man who is convicted of a capital crime because of his indifference on trial and elsewhere in the novel. Meursault, the man whose major crime is his inability to express, murders a man on a beach. Feeling uncomfortable and oppressed by a blinding sun that &quot;shatter[s] into little pieces on the sand and water&quot; into his eyes, Meursault accidentally pulls the trigger of his readied gun, killing the man brandishing a knife at him. The striking feature of this novel lies in Camus' ease in completely incorporating the major motif of the novel: circularity. Circular symbols permeate its every aspect. This circle technique allows the book to comment on life, paradoxically conveying its message through an examination of death. Sun and water themes circulate around each other and are accented by the circular structure of the book itself. These themes also serve to emphasize the motif of contrasting elements that makes this book so complete in its integration. A simple writing style serves to illustrate the simplicity of the novels concept. Working similarly to Hemmingway's style, Camus writes in an extremely fluent way, which also suggests the symbolism of water. This book is one of the best out their.

There are several different styles of this kind of honour; some authors pick up on details from canonical stories (there are 56 short stories and four novels penned by Conan Doyle); some invent entirely new fictional stories; then there is a third style, in which the author grafts Holmes and Watson onto historical or nearly historical situations.This last method was employed in film-making during World War II, when Holmes was engaged in fighting the Nazi powers on behalf of Britain. Thomas keeps the stories he has developed within the typical timeframe of Holmes' canonical life - late Victorian and Edwardian times.In 'The Ghost in the Machine', the case turns on an error of forensic investigation. In fact, Conan Doyle himself was once enlisted to try to clear a man using Holmesian methodology - this combines a real-life case with another real-life application and overlays the fictional detective on top of it.The other stories in the collection are similarly based on actual historical events - this a sort of a 'what if' collection, speculating what might have happened had Holmes and Watson been available to do their investigation.The stories are engaging, but have more to do with presenting a history than with really creating a new Holmesian addition. The stories are reasonably well written, but lack the style of Conan Doyle to the extent that even a good photocopy lacks the authenticity of the original.This book is a must for those who want to be widely read and kept up with the games that are afoot in the continuing development of Holmesian lore. Fans who come to read this without the expectation that these are canonical or of the same quality as the better of Conan Doyle's pieces will not be disappointed."
B000O27M5K,Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews,,A2KB65SOJ51T4C,"David A. Bielby ""Ev Xpistw""",44/44,5.0,1183248000,A first rate commentary on Hebrews,"I have to disagree with two of the reviewers here who have some negative comments on this commentary. As I am preaching through Hebrews, I've been looking at a number of commentaries. I look for helpful exegetical comments and summarizations, interaction with other scholarly viewpoints, and for spirituality in the comments. I believe Bruce gives us all three categories.Let me illustrate what I mean. F.F. Bruce sees Hebrews 1 as part of a larger section of material extending through the end of chapter 2. He titles this 'The Finality of Christianity'. He then breaks chapter 1 into two parts, v.1-4 (more than prophets, Jesus is God) and 5-14 (superior to the angelic beings-citing seven groups of verses). He points out there are seven statements about Christ in v. 1-4 and seven scripture quote sections in v.5-14. He then goes on to draw implications from these that are helpful for the scholar somewhat, but more so for a bible course teacher or a preacher in the pulpit. One of his applications is the demolition of the JW view that Christ was originally an angel. After all the second section deals entirely with the concept that Christ is superior to angels.His exegetical comments on the term 'universe' in Hebrews 1 help cut the legs out from under a lynch pin in the heretical view called 'open theism'. Although he doesn't take time to dive into the controversies, if you are familiar with them even a little, his comments are enough to help you realize that these verses are very significant in crucial debates among contemporary Evangelical circles.I just found the observations he makes skip over the superfluous ones I have read in some other commentaries. His points seem pretty convincing and pretty relevant. I think this is another excellent commentary from F.F. Bruce. It's amazing to me that one man could produce so many good commentaries on so many different books of the bible.I also think his material would help a SS teacher who goes deep in his classes. Although one doesn't need to know Greek to use this commentary, he deals with significant points in the Greek text.Again in chapter 1 he points out that the scepter of uprightness uses a term which originally meant 'straight'. The idea of just or straight measurements does help clarify the exact nuance of the sort of rule referenced by this passage (I don't think this is an etymological fallacy-but a helpful insight by Bruce).After reading several commentators besides Bruce, I found others to either lack in exegetical balance but to contain a lot of spiritual vim and vigor...or to be exceptionally boring and technical. This commentary blends scholarship and spirituality well. I would say it is truly superior to most of the other commentaries I have. Other excellent ones on Hebrews include Ellingworth and Murray. Lane is good also."

Pringle's biography on Theodore Roosevelt to be bit overrated. Probably because it was published back in 1931 that make the material so dated. Passage of time and reassessment of Theodore Roosevelt make this book somewhat of an oddity. Despite of being published just 12 years after Roosevelt's death, it was interesting to read that this was basically a pretty negative outlook on a great American. The style of his writing, the way he jumped forward and backward simply confused the subject matter sometimes. It doesn't helped that the author never really get into the mind, personality and motives of his subject. Many of the issues surrounding Roosevelt's life are simply not in-depth enough to be interesting or informative.I supposed for readers back in the 1930s, this book had a lot to offered. But nowadays, with works by Edmund Morris, David McCullough, Nathan Miller and Kathleen Dalton, there is really very little purpose in reading this book. It doesn't offered any thing new nor offered any great insights.I read it because it was so highly acclaimed back then. It won the Pulitzer Prize and won high reviews back then. But reading it now after going through many of the modern materials on Roosevelt, make Pringle's work looked weak and stale.Not really recommended for anyone unless your curiousity get aroused by ancient work."

The events are complete non sequiturs and the changes in plot are worse.It appears to be a spoiled child wandering in a world she does not understand, nor is willing to learn about - unlike Lucy in The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe who seeks to understand the local customs and circumstances.The book is very easy to read but it leaves distaste in my literary mouth. I know it is considered a classic but I just do not see it, and if I did not have to read it for school I would not have bothered to finish it.(First written as Journal Reading Notes in 1999.)Through the Looking GlassThough this book is not much better than Alice's Adventures, the chess motif and theme does make the book much more interesting. With the bossy, dominant Red Queen and the quiet, kind, messy white queen, the book is a study in contrasts.The interweaving of the Nursery Rhyme Characters and the frequent fish poetry references does provide more continuity and a sense of sequential events than Alice's first adventure. I also appreciated the linking of the cat at the beginning and end of the story.It does still feel like Carroll did way too many opium pipes in his time.(First written as Journal Reading Notes in 1999.)"

But this book lags behind 1984 in the literary sense.Make no mistake. Huxley was a genius. He was far ahead of his time and had many ideas about the future that have become real. But the problem with the book is his writing.Orwell is such a fantastic writer that, while you shudder at the bleak vision he has for the world, you become more interested in the characters of the book. Huxley's characters are just props. Huxley felt like sharing his ideas, but he couldn't just write about them. It seems like he just inserted the characters in so that there would actually be some in the book. Without good characters, a book seriously lags. If Huxley had just been a better writer, the book would be worthy of the comparisons to 1984 that it always recieves."

They are not photojournalistic shots of combat, but depict the moments between the bullets, sometimes heartbreakingly accompanied with descriptions of how and when the men depicted died.This book is a sort of letter of love to the author's fellow men-at-arms: draftees and volunteers, at turns confused, brash, scared, duplicitous and tender.

It turns out that their stories are connected to each other and the picture created is really a masterwork. The story is really plain and minimally told. This book teaches you about storytelling and about avoiding useless words. As it happens, the book does not have what I like most about books. It does not tell you about the characters. It only documents what they are doing. The author says nothing about their hopes, their dreams, not even their past. We do not learn a single thing about the people that fill this book, why they are what they are and what makes them decide what they decide. I would say it is a good book, as I would say Van Gogh did good paintig. But I wouldnt put a Van Gogh in my apartment because I simply dont LIKE them. So, before you decide to read this book find out, what you like about books. If it is the plot, you might like it. If it is the people, you might not like it. As I dont like it."

I was very impressed with both the depth and breadth of the text, as I found the text to include an impressive balance of both.Our final project for the course was a &#34;historiography&#34; paper (or the &#34;history of history&#34;). For this project we examined seven text books, comparing purposes, organization, etc. I found that the Grout by far met my needs, as an undergraduate music performance student, the best. I believe, it's the industry standard because it's truly excellent. While there are texts that provide more depth and others for a more general audience, Grout, et al. provide a solid introduction (as a music history course should) to the field, providing sufficient examination of the music itself and the background of the composers.Below is an excerpt from my final paper for the course. For this I chose to compare the treatment of Beethoven in each of the seven texts.&#34;For the past semester, I have been reading from A History of Western Music by J. Peter Burkholder as my primary source for studying music history and therefore it has been very influential in my conception of music history and how it should be taught and studied. Burkholder devotes nearly an entire chapter to the composer, thus emphasizing his centrality in the development of music. The entire text is very well organized, being systematically broken down essentially into an outline; this carries through in the discussion on Beethoven. After a brief introduction, Burkholder discusses Beethoven according to the three periods of his life. He provides an account of the circumstances in each period and a description of a piece from each of the three periods (which are also in the accompanying anthology and recording set). This allows the reader to have an aural, visual, and descriptive comparison of the changes in Beethoven&#8217;s music. The model of Haydn and Mozart in the Pathetique Sonata, the heroism of the Eroica Symphony and the characteristic inwardness of the late period in Op. 131 are seen, heard and described in the chapter (and accompanying scores). Burkholder not only refers to both the track number of the accompanying CD set and the page in the anthology, guiding the reader to the music, but marks the references in a different colored ink. He includes several source readings, musical excerpts, timelines, pictures, diagrams, and other resources throughout the chapter for the greater comprehension of the reader. Together these elements provide strong evidence for the &#34;centrality of Beethoven&#34; discussed at the conclusion of the chapter.&#34;"
B0007EN3PS,"Leaves of grass,",,A3QZCA4LTTVGAD,Michael J. Mazza,16/18,5.0,998179200,Give the 1855 version a try,"What more can be said about Walt Whitman's &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;? This 19th century work is more than just a poetic masterpiece; it is a pivotal landmark in the history of world literature. Read &quot;Leaves&quot; and you will understand why Whitman is hailed as a poetic ancestor by poets, both male and female, of many different ethnic and national backgrounds. His is truly a universal voice.Whitman published the first edition of &quot;Leaves&quot; in 1855, and continued to revise and expand the book until it had grown into the monumental final version. While the &quot;deathbed&quot; edition is an essential text, I'd like to put in a plug for the much smaller 1855 edition, which has been reprinted with an introduction by Malcolm Cowley. The &quot;deathbed&quot; edition may be too large and intimidating a literary tapestry for Whitman &quot;virgins&quot;; the reprinted 1855 edition may thus be a good way to begin exploring the bounteous poetic talent and vision of this giant.The Cowley-introduced edition also includes Whitman's original prose introduction, which is itself a remarkable piece of literature. While the 1855 &quot;Leaves&quot; is missing vast sections of the deathbed version, it is still a stunning work of art that succeeds as a self-sufficient piece of literature and philosophy. In this &quot;embryonic&quot; version of the soon-to-evolve masterpiece, we already discover Whitman's pungent eroticism, his embrace of paradox, and his playful theological exploration. His language is sensuous, outrageous, tender, and amazing, and is full of compassion for all living beings.Whitman is more than just a great poet; his work is a sort of prophecy for both the secular and multifaith worlds. So read &quot;Leaves&quot; in either the embryonic version or the ultimate version, and embark on an unforgettable poetic journey."

The vivid and sickening first person accounts should cause any reader to question whether resorting to nuclear force is ever justified.

The horror of Hiroshima and Nakasaki is partly responsible, I think, for the fact that no atomic weapons have been used in warfare since then.

""Nearly 70% of adjuncts earn over $2,001 per course"". Then a TABLE showing that if you teach 5 classes at $2,500, that makes $12,500. 9 courses would be $22,500. Yes, it is that bad. Not one number showing what any real university pays at any point in time for any type of course.Don't bother. A couple internet searches will yield better results."

And was it ever! Brian gets a hatchet as a gift from his mother, and when his little plane crashes in a lake in the Canadian wilderness, he finds many ways to use his new hatchet to keep himself alive. He uses his hatchet to protect himself from a porcupine that tries to attack him in the middle of the night; he also uses the hatchet to make firewood to keep himself warm at night. Brian spends 54 days in the woods, by himself. A twister turns the crashed plane so that the tail sticks out of the lake, and another plane, flying overhead, sees the tail sticking out of the water. The pilot lands his plane on the lake and when he sees Brian he realizes he's found the kid that searchers stopped looking for weeks ago. Remember this book when you go the bookstore, it's great!"

B000OUK4JI,The Word,,A26SZ1TM36UQLI,CKop,3/4,4.0,1171065600,A dusty but musty bit of fun,"The story is dated for the time it was written, circa early 1970s. There are no computers; people get messages in person, and corpulent beings answer telephones. It was politically incorrect before anyone even knew that there were rules to what they should think and say. For younger readers, it may be a near impossibility to read. They'll stumble on the simple concept of having to actually rise and approach a television to change the channel manually or stick their fingers into a hole on the telephone dial.(I have a second print soft copy that is, aside from the yellowed pages, in remarkably good shape. It was $1.95 sold new.)As for the story...The storyline is similar to the Code: heretical but not identical. Here we have James, brother of Jesus, relating what happened after the Crucifixion. But all is not set in stone. The hero (or maybe not, depending on how you read it) goes up against the odds to find a hidden truth. Along the way, there are familiar encounters with names like Opus Dei. Yup, they make a brief appearance here too.If you paid attention to the recent uprising displayed by the Christian establishment when the DaVinci Code was released, you'll have some idea of the revolt that was seen when this book was popular. I remember it quite clearly.The book is old, the story (again) dated but it's an affordable distraction. Anyway, to tell more would be to sell the farm. (No peeking ;)Besides all of that... remember a few years back when that bone box was found that was purportedly once the home of the bones of James, brother of Jesus?It's almost like there is some secret organization that surfaces stories and such, generation to generation, on the subject of Jesus' mortality. One can trace them easily enough with a little research. That's not to say that any of it is true but it's sure enough an added bonus to any reader who enjoys a grail quest simply for the fun of it.The debunker, stick-in-the-mud types will ignore this though... and maintain their close relationships with the dust mites and moss. Let `em be.PS- (Not Priory of Sion or Princess Sophie) The miniseries that was based on this book vacuumed pretty badly. A David Jansen vehicle, it is one of those `70's made-for-TV productions that made viewers cringe at the mere mention of the term, `miniseries'.Read the book but then avoid the video like the plague."

Drunken Farmer Jones is OUT, and the Idealistic Farm Animals are IN. Injustice is to be expunged, and Order and Harmony restored in a democratic environment where the Lion lays down with the Lamb. Suffice it to say, as Scottish Poet Robert Burns indicated;""The best-laid schemes o' mice an 'men Gang aft agley,...etc.""[see ""To A Mouse, On Turning Her Up In Her Nest With The Plough"" 1785]One of the most powerfully told stories, the brief tale is about a host of farm animals who are enslavedby Propaganda-Spewing Hogs, whose Self-Centered Hypocrisy and Brainwashing Sloganeering enable them to destroy the lives of all the other farm animals by exploiting their labor and their naive and idealistic minds.The book tells the tale of what happens when ""people"" do not learn to think for themselves,and who permit themselves to be intimidated by tyrants.But why buy this 50th Anniversary Edition? The Illustrations are magnificent.These powerful graphics are the work of Ralph Steadman, who has won international awards.Children will especially find that this edition enhances their appreciation of this story.Also, this 50th Anniversary Edition, a hardback, contains George Orwell's unpublished PREFACE to the original edition, and also his Preface to the 1947 Ukrainian Edition..The essential characters are as follows:(a) The drunken Farmer Jones and his wife.(b) ""Major"" the wise old White Hog who shares his revelationand wisdom with the gathered farm animals. You may recall that the movie ""Babe"" about the sheepherding pig?""Babe"" was a White also, so that gives some idea of the breed of Whites and what they look like.(c) Two other pigs, Napolean and Snowball, manage to acquire control of the animals by theirgood intentions, cunning, and impassioned rhetorics.(d) Boxer is the large workhorse who supplies the muscle in the farm's reconstruction projects for a Utopian existence of Fodder, Freedom, and Frolic.(e) Benjamin is a cynical, yet wise old Donkey who is Boxer's friend and companion.There is a host of minor characters to fill out the story..There are two movies made from the story, but both (1954 and 1999) differ from the original story, so I cannot recommend those.The book is full of its dramatic contemplations of fate, moments of terror, and open battles from factions representing both Good and Evil..This is one of the Must-Read storybooks in Western Civilization.."
B0006R2DJS,Astronomical calendar 1999,,AEJFGI0AX395M,Troy Riedel,1/1,5.0,1167004800,The best annual astronomical almanac available!,"Buyer beware: please do not be fooled by the title. This is NOT a calendar, but rather a very thorough (82-page) astronomical almanac. This is arguably the best astronomical resource an amateur astronomer can buy.This power-packed almanac has almost everything an amateur astronomer could want:(a) Monthly sky maps with recommended ""telescopic"" tour objects;(b) Monthly observer highlights with date/times of significant astronomical events;(c) Monthly east and/or west horizon & sky highlights charts for each month showing ecliptic and path/location of the evening and/or morning planets, sun & moon with significant conjunctions for the month;(d) Detailed ""strip-charts"" of astronomical twilight, hours of ""dark sky"" and ""moonlight"" (which could interfere with dark sky observation);(e) Detailed chapters re: lunar & solar eclipses;(f) Corkscrew charts of the major Jovian and Saturian moons for each day of the year;(g) Finder charts for Uranus, Neptune and Pluto;(h) Meteor Showers (major & minor) with burst/outburst predictions (dates/times);(i) Asteroids incl. finder charts for the big 5;(j) Comets with brightness predictions and detailed finder charts;(k) Occultations incl. binocular & telescope events;(l) And even general information re: measuring light pollution, magnitude, significant spaceflight information, and a small section on selected deep-sky profiles.And I haven't even mentioned it contains one of the best astronomical glossaries of any astronomy book on my bookshelf.Admittedly, this almanac looks intimidating to beginner's. But the author has an excellent explanation of how to use this publication - and interpreting the data quickly becomes a snap.The only publication out there that comes close to this is the annual RASC Handbook. But mano y mano, this publication packs a greater wallop by giving more information, more detail and definitely more value considering the price of each.This book is published annually in October of each year. I ordered mine in advance and had it delivered in plenty of time (prior to 1 November) so I could start my annual planning in advance.This publication is a must for serious amateurs who own telescopes. But given the detailed information re: the moon, eclipses and sky highlights (and the great glossary), even observers without a telescope will benefit.Bottom-line: if you find that you want or need more detail than the online astronomy magazine sites provide, or you want information you normally fnd from multiple Internet sites, or you wish to plan observations for later in the year - definitely consider buying this publication! But remember, this is not a wall calendar but rather a detailed astronimical almanac - on steroids!"

In fact, the only reason it didn't get five stars from me is because as this is a re-print, there are a couple of typos and other little things of that nature that distract from the story, but they are not so frequent the story is really ruined so it's not a big deal, I only knocked off one star. The print/type looks very ""computer-ish"" but aside from that, once you get used to it, it's perfect.The hardcover binding is very nice. I can't say much for the quailty of the glue, but over-all the book and its binding resembles a school textbook and is very easy to carry around and reasonably durable. As far as prettiness goes, the greenish blue colouring of the book and the seal for the company is pleasant to look at.The story is wonderful. As I'm sure anyone who's seen the 1980s movie (which was a pretty faithful adaption) already knows. Following the lives of two children who are stranded on an island and grow up into beautiful teenagers and fall in love, it's very cute and romantic. And as this is a hard-to-find book, buying this edition, re-print though it is, is a good idea.I had a great time with this book and was very pleased with my purchase."

Poirot is concerned by an anonymous letter he has received, stating, ""look out for Andover, on the 21st of the month."" It is signed simply, ""ABC"". When an elderly woman, named Ascher, is found murdered in her little newsagent shop, Poirot and Hastings become involved in a case which is different to any they have faced before. It seems a homicidal maniac is striking victims at random, based only on the first letters of their name and the place that they live. An ABC railway guide is always placed on or near the vitim. As the bodies mount, the families and friends of the victims propose working with Poirot, to help solve the case.This novel shows why Agatha Christie is still the best crime writer of all time. The book may be set in the 1930's, but she has such an understanding of human nature and her plot and characters all stand the test of time. Her books never drag, are always immensely readable and Poirot - well, he is simply the best fictional detective ever created. Enjoy!"

I could sense the writer struggling against writer's block or imagination failure or something, and it took forever to plod through the staggering, wordy, pieced-together writing of the first third of the book. I doubt it would ever have made it past the slop pile nowadays. A second or third draught might have been a good idea.Anne was very wise and introspective, and while it works great later in the story, in the beginning, I came about half an inch from reaching into the book and cuffing her a good one. Seriously, quit with the pity party Miss Elliot and quit sabotaging yourself.Seems that there were quite a lot of serendipitous plot engines, too. I had a wee bit of trouble suspending my disbelief in some of the more convenient circumstances that occurred later on, and while a little bit of coincidence is never a bad thing, when multiple instances of situations reading like they were manufactured with the express purpose of working out something mentioned no more than two pages (or paragraphs) back, I start to feel like I'm being forced at gun point over a rickety bridge of plot points rather than being gently guided along a carefully crafted path of meticulously arranged thoughts to the inevitable, but still rewarding conclusion.If you have to read this for some strange reason, I'm sorry for you. You'll have to commit to the beginning. If you're reading for leisure, suffer chapters one and perhaps two, then skim the next eight or ten. You won't miss too much, and the writing becomes much more tolerable thereafter. And, if I'm wrong and you find yourself lost, skip to the last three chapters, because they're all anyone ever read this book for to begin with, and you'll get a fairly good summation of it therein."

This is a great book, and it's the only book I liked that I ever read in English class along with 'Anthem' and 'Of Mice and Men'. Like most books it goes slow at first, but you get into it more and more. Although I really, really do like this book, I refuse to see the movie which stars Ethan Hawke and Gwenyth Paltrow, because just by looking at the commericals and the pictures from the movie, I could tell that it's not like the book at all and for that, I know that I would hate it. As a matter of fact, my friend told me that it wasn't. So, I refuse to see the movie, but I was able to see an older movie of the book and I liked it, because it was like the book and that's what I like.

Clark,0/2,3.0,1239753600,Good - Not Great,"I purchased this novel after hearing so much about how influential it is and how it may be the perfect novel. In capturing Realism or being a classic demonstration of Victorian Age style and values, it does succeed; but in terms of creating an emotional bond with the reader or creating deep characters, it fails.The first couple chapters are a little odd since they spend most of the time giving the reader the background of Charles Bovary, which tried to give the reader some idea of how his mind works, but never quite makes him come to life. After he meets his future wife, Emma, he pretty much becomes a piece of furniture in the background of her story. The author successfully describes the slow boring pace of provincial life in mid-1800 France by boring us with two dimensional characters, some of which talk non-stop.Really the only thing that the reader can sink their teeth into is Emma Bovary's naive, mercurial, and over romanticized behavior. The woman has no moral scruples, no grasp of reality, and goes through such wild mood swings that the reader could easily guess that she is mentally ill. Poor Charles has no idea any of this is coming as he, like the reader, has no idea she is this unhinged from our first encounters with her. The reader is taken on a wild ride that spirals out of control until her life and the life of her doting husband end in complete tragedy.Pros:1. If you like the all too quaint works of the Brontes and Wharton you'll probably like this story.2. Descriptive narration when it comes to scenery3. Two characters in this book really stand out. The Apothecary has non-stop mouth that makes you want to slap him; and the emotionally infantile Emma Bovary.4. Is the gold standard for Victorian era writing (such as it is.)Cons:1. Only the two characters stand out and have any sort of depth. Most are stereotypical caricatures.2. The book would be a few dozen pages shorter without the Apothecary.3. For all the talk about scandal and affairs, this story could be read by a elementary school child and not offend them. If it wasn't for Bovary talking about the affairs, I would have been sure she had them.4. I didn't really care when I finished reading it. I didn't want to know more about the characters or want to look for more of the author's work.Bottom Line: If you're literary glutton should should probably read this book just because. For men, this book can be very instrumental in defining that the term ""damaged goods"" means when it come to women. For women, let Bovary's bad-girl antics and miserable end speak for themselves."

As one medical doctor and Ph.D. at the National Institutes of Health said, `Most people are not going to believe the breakthroughs that are coming in the very near future.'&quot; Children soaring through the air on beautiful gilded wings, babies born with no faces in a covert lab where they will be used strictly for body parts may soon be more than just an author's &quot;what if.&quot; James Patterson excels in this, his most exciting book yet, as he tells the story of veterinarian Frannie O'Neill, who withdrew to a sequestered life in her Colorado practice following the mysterious death of her husband several years before. Frannie's seclusion is disrupted when she allows her new tenant, Kit Harrison into her life. Handsome and friendly Kit is an FBI agent posing as a hunter. He is chasing a tip about a secret scientific lab where scientists are conducting genetic experiments. Frannie is disturbed even more when she sees an angelic little girl in the woods near her animal hospital lift her arms and spread her feathered wings. Eleven-year-old Max is the result of a monumental conspiracy revolving around secret genetic research and the scientific manipulation of the human species. Where did Max come from? Why is she more intelligent at age 11 than anyone twice her age? And most perplexing, how was she born with wings? &quot;When the Wind Blows&quot; just may be closer to the truth than you want to believe. I was first introduced to Patterson's work when a friend loaned me his copy of &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot; a few years ago. I was hooked from the first page and since that day I have read everything I could find that he has written. Patterson is perhaps the most gifted author of our time. His ability and imagination have no bounds. His Alex Cross series is extremely popular, but rather than fall into the rut of many famous authors, capitalizing only on the success of one subject, he varies his themes. Between Cross books he lends his talent to a multitude of subjects. &quot;When the Wind Blows&quot; has proven so popular in Palm Beach that Classic Bookshop at 310 South County Road has devoted an entire window display to the book. Royal Palm Beach resident Virginia Jacobus and her staff have been recommending it to their customers. &quot;I just could not put this book down,&quot; Jacobus said. &quot;This is probably his best yet.&quot;"

It is a testament to many of the uncelebrated lives that survived WW2 and what they went on to create.

I thought thatbecause it expressed the feelings of every character in a certain waythat was so real and it made me feel so into the book. THe part where i really got into the book was when Carlson went out and shot Candy's dog and i started talking to the book because i think that that was really rude. I started to cry when i was watching the movie when Carlson shot Candy's dog because candy was with that dog for a long time and i thought that it was really mean that Carlson thought that it would be ok that he shot the dog. Even if the dog is deaf Candy took care of it and didn't let anything happended to it. He really loved that dog. I also liked how they made Lenny sound so hopeless and how he reacted to the puppy and how he was just like my 6 year old sister. She always comes up to me and says if i do this can you give me something and it is kind of the same as Lenny wanting to tend the rabbits if he did something good... Lenny did live a hard and wild life including that he always had something going on in his life that got him in trouble. I reccomend this book to anyone who likes short and exciting books read this one.

While it helps the reader better understand how the human brain works, don't expect to be able to use that understanding to your advantage. In fact, while the book provides a fascinating discovery of how the human brain ""thin slices"" both people and events, the main takeaway from this is that thin slicing is either accurate or it's not.Gladwell points out some cases where thin slicing based on limited information is just as accurate (or more accurate) as making a decision on piles of research. In other cases, thin slicing causes us to have wrong impressions about a person and therefore causing us to make wrong decisions. Even still, there are the instances where thin slicing completely fails and everything goes sour.The one thing I did take away, is that the human brain is not always capable of allowing us to verbally explain the things we do or think. Unless you're particularly skilled in a certain area, once you try to explain why you initially think this or that, the reasoning begins to break down and often fails entirely. This can then cause us to come to conclusions that are contrary to what we really believe. Strange, yeah, I know.That's what makes Blink fascinating. The human brain is so complex that it often doesn't even work in the ways we would think. But it can be trained. Immerse yourself into something and your brain develops the capability of knowing why you like or dislike certain things or even to read things in high-stress situations that the normal person would not.As a business owner I didn't find Blink to be as useful as The Tipping Point, also from Gladwell, but the author does have a way of bringing oddities to light and presents them in a fascinating way."

However, this turned out to be a HUGE disappointment - so much so that I ended up skipping after 100 pages to the end because I just couldn't take it anymore. The heroine, Ellie, is extremely annoying, whose personality apparently dictated that she act like a waspish, humorless shrew towards the hero, who was nothing but kind and charming to her. Also, there were huge chunks of the book where NOTHING was happening except for the boring and increasingly annoying back-and-forth dialogue between Ellie and Charles, which did nothing to advance the story. It got to be so annoying that I had to stop. You could tell Ms. Quinn was trying very hard to be witty in these passages, but it fell spectacularly flat. Would not recommend."

This nineteenth century classic has been credited variously with being a complex mathematical puzzle, a dream, a cynical allegory on modern civilization, a drug-induced hallucination, or just a fanciful child's tale. I lean toward the latter. Whatever the truth, the book has stood the test of time, and continues to intrigue children even today.

Melvin Ely combines a professor's concern for factualness with thorough, ground-breaking research and a novelist's way with narrative into an unfailingly entertaining work that is also of great and lasting academic, social and cultural importance. Ely has delivered a fascinating show business yarn with absorbing insight into human nature, sometimes noble, often naive, and occasionally downright repugnant. While not afraid to add an edge of attitude or a clear point of view when he chooses, the author still eschews easy answers and the predictable pedantics and prejudice of an ideologue of any political persuasion. With subtle surety, and never a trace of condescension, Ely ultimately shows us ourselves--good, bad and ugly--in an absorbing saga of American life and culture."

B000I1S0YY,"Rabbit, Run",,A2IWPHLMC27NKZ,H. Huggins,3/4,4.0,1084924800,One of the best characters in 'recent' fiction,"This book was not an easy one to get into. It definitely starts slow, with descriptions and monologues overrunning the plot for a time. But it doesn't take too long for the reader to fall in love with Rabbit.Rabbit is a young, married father who is unhappy with his lower middle class life and unexpectedly deserts his wife and son while on an errand. He moves in with the town floozie and plays house while trying to figure out exactly what to do. He is befriended by a priest who tries to set him on the right path during weekly golf rounds. Despite his selfishness and arrogance, Rabbit manages to be immensely likable; somehow i was rooting for this adulterer and liar to succeed in the end. This is mainly due to Updike's skills as a writer. He doesn't paint a pretty picture of his characters or make them bastions of morality. Instead, they are entirely human, which makes them incredibly easy to relate to. I underlined several passages in the book as being remarkably insightful. Updike is able to describe the human condition in three sentences when it would take three paragraphs for even the most skilled writers. At least in this respect, Updike is very similar to my favorite American author, Richard Russo.Updike peppers his book with humor and tragedy, making &quot;Rabbit, Run&quot; a bit of a roller coaster and always surprising. His cast of characters (especially the minister's wife) are colorful and dynamic. Appropriately, there's no great moral at the end (again: Russo), leaving the way open for the other Rabbit books, which after this great opening salvo, I can't wait to read.4 stars."

Ross West has the hard won experience and spiritual depth needed to really be a guide to many of us in this challenging area. He addresses many areas such as responding to unethical situations and seeing spiritual value in our work/in others. He establishes a useful theology of why we work and what our work means and then proceeds to show many practical examples of how that theology can be applied in everyday work-a-day life. One of my favorite parts of the book is the simple but profound observation that we can and should view our work, no matter what it is, as ultimately helping another person somewhere. It's hard to think of a job where this is not the case and even though my technology job is somewhat removed from people directly, it does help them elsewhere. The book caused me to reflect on my work in constructive ways after years of confusion on this topic. I have already recommended the book to some close Christian friends who have the same challenges. It is not easy to find books that are as theologically sound and practical as this one. I am starting to read William E. Diehl who has also written in this area."

He journeys through a world filled with intelligent animals ranging from dogs to squirrels to birds to more, eventually meeting up with the source of much evil in the world. Tailchaser comes of age and learns much about himself and about the value of friendship -- and about what love really is.I encountered this book first as a 20something, and I've read my way through two copies so far.

(having said that, this book is excellent, and you really ought to check it out).this book brings people together under one banner. it does not play inherent gender differences off on one another. you will be able to raise your understanding of others by a significant amount, and look inwardly to find out the nature and name of those buttons that your partner may press.""Take your life into your own hands, and what happens.

This book goes after everyone, which is the source of its humor as well as its chief weakness. Jews, cops, lesbians, gay men,widows, bimbos, suburbanites, and so on and so on behave just like their worst stereotypes. If you think this is funny, read the book. If you think this is offensive, leave the book alone. If you stay for the book, you'll be treated to a rollicking, picaresque plot and encounter in Ignatius one of American literature's true originals. For what it is, A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES is first rate."

I realize that Clue mysteries have always been light, but it loses something with the &quot;I killed him because he made a mess of the house&quot; or &quot;Look he's dead - anyone want to go for coffee&quot; style.

After a nuclear holocaust, an order of monks has preserved what they can of civilization -- it's a deliberate reference to the European ""Dark Ages"", and Miller carries it off well. Society rebuilds itself... only to fall into warfare once again.I found myself wanting to hear some of the stories mentioned only in passing here -- the abandoned and betrayed Laredan troops particularly caught my interest -- and that, I think, is a sign of good worldbuilding.The story is told in episodes, some hundreds or more years apart, but the characters are still quite engaging. Miller's writing is a little old-fashioned and expository, but is also clear, lucid and precise. The combination of powerful themes and understated language makes this book a genuinely moving one which, in my view, deserves credit as bonafide literature."

The sides of the pages bear index tabs, but the Catholic books (e.g., Wisdom, Sirach) are not included on the tabs (the books are included in the Bible, but you'll have to remember their locations in the Old Testament).The one caveat with this Bible is that the pages are quite thin - I end up turning the pages very carefully.

I read it for English this year. I think that if I hadn't been reading this for the class with deadlines and analyzing it and all, I would have enjoyed it much more. I did like it. Certainly. At times, it was great, and I just kept on reading.The characters are pretty easy to relate to. You have the damsel in distress-- Lucie Manette, loving and kind to everybody. She really is the ideal Victorian Woman (Dickens was Victorian). Then you have her man-- Charles Darnay, rich, perfect guy, somewhat boring, gets himself into a couple of scrapes and needs help in getting bailed out. There is the worthless man who loves heroine but knows he can't have her and will risk anything for her-- Sydney Carton, looks just like Darnay, saves him a couple of times, drunkard, loves Lucie, knows is a failure and does not think he can change. Then we have the father-- Alexandre Manette, a little weary of Darnay at beginning, has reason to be so, Lucie is dedicated to him hand and foot. The revolutionary crazy woman-- Madame Defarge, quite the vengance, according to Dicken's vision, she is simply a dark haired Lucie. And the loveable father figure-- Lorry, sweet, rigid at first, but loosens up.well, the book is well written most of the time, but there are some parts where it is really obvious that dickens is getting paid by the word. he also skips some important stuff or summarizes in a chapter. There is one point where he is describing how time passes and talks about Lucie's children and all, and he kinda spends two pages discussing like 7 years or something, found that kinda confusing, and there were a few other parts like that.Still, the book is important for any well-read person to have read.

Cardinal Bernardin was a remarkable man who had the courage to face his accusers, his illness and ulitmately his death. He has reconfirmed that faith, hope, love, forgivenss and kindness is the very essentials of what life needs to be about. It is clear from the Cardinal as it was from my experience with my own father that even when you think you are at your darkest human hour you need to reach out and make a difference every single day until your final moment in this part of your journey here on earth.This book is a must read for anyone who has doubted that there is peace in death. He reconfirms that the lessons most important in life are to continue to give of yourself every day despite the adversities you face. In his illness, through his false accusation and his wonderful rediscovery of a deeper faith in Christ it makes accepting God's plan for you important.Anyone who has an ill parent or someone close to them should read this book it will give you a much clearer spiritual understanding of illness, death and living every moment under God's plan."

I couldnt imagine that in 2002, ""There are now 84,000 prostitutes operating on the streets of Tehran and 250 brothels, ... 60 new runaway girls hitting Tehran's streets everyday...Forty percent of all drug addicted women in Iranian prisons have AIDS...Unemployment which is already around 30 percent) is steadily rising."" pg 280Of course this book is not about showing bad looking statistics from credible Middle East sources. It preached viable solutions that Bush had not adopted. To name a few: ""Frankly, I hope Saddam disappears tomorrow. But even if he does, that's not going to solve our problem. Saddam is a conventional threat who can be eliminated by conventional means. He inspires no one. The idea people who inspired the hijackers are religious leaders, pseudo-intellectuals, pundits and educators, primiarily in Eygpt and in Saudia Arabia, which continues to use its vast oil wealth to spread its austere and intolerant brand of Islam, Wahabism. June 2002."" Pg 265 and ""If we've learned one thing since 9/11, it's that terrorism is not produced by the poverty of money. It's produced by the poverity of dignity. It is about young middle class Arabs and Muslims feeling trapped in countries with too few good jobs and too few opportunities to realize their potential or shape their own future - and blaming America for it. We have to break the cycle...June 2002."" Pg 270To counter the pro American impression from the examples I quoted above, ""This is not to say that US policy is blameless. We do bad things sometimes. But why is it that only Muslims react to our bad policies with suicidal terrorism, not Mexians or Chinese? Is it because ...Jews could not be so strong on their own...the United States created and supports Israel?

Upon the marriage of her governess, a match Emma purports to have arranged herself, Emma next turns to finding a suitable husband for her new young friend, Harriet Smith. She encourages Harriet into an infatuation with the vicar, Mr. Elton. Her plans fall apart, however, when Elton reveals to Emma that she is the true object of his affections. Rejected, Mr. Elton flees to Bath and finds a wife almost immediately. When the long-awaited Frank Churchill finally comes to visit, the entire social set of Highbury is swept into a tangle of suspicion, charm and deceit. Although Frank is commonly viewed as a perfect match for Emma, she feels only friendship for him, and views him instead as a potential husband for Harriet. In spite of Emma's multiple failed attempts at matchmaking, there are two couples married and one engaged by the end of the novel.Jane Austen was one of eight children, the daughter of an upper middle-class clergyman. Although her family was not wealthy, they led comfortable, socially respectable lives. Well-educated and with a love of reading, Jane Austen began to write at the age of twelve. She never married. Her first novel, Sense & Sensibility, was published in 1811, followed by Pride & Prejudice. All of her novels were published anonymously. She died in 1817, and is buried in Winchester Cathedral.I found this book to be as charming and delightful as the film, which I first fell in love with long ago. Jane Austen's wit is very much in evidence throughout the novel, and greatly improves what might otherwise be a somewhat dry style. Austen referred to Emma as ""a heroine whom no one but myself will like much."" However, I found Emma to be engaging and delightful. I recommend this book to all fans of Jane Austen."

The primary reason I'm writing this review is because I don't think the other reviewers have given a completely accurate view of the book. I've just finished the book and have very mixed feelings about it which I don't think the other reviewers give justice.My first and biggest argument with the book is that it is completely based on the mankind-exploits-everything viewpoint. A quick look at our collective history does not disagree with that viewpoint, but a more detailed look at history does. Mankind has been evolving as a social critter at a fantastic rate for the last 600 years or so. Things that came naturally in the Dark and Middle Ages in Europe such as witch-burning and stoning people to death are now viewed with total revulsion. Cynics (pragmatists?) will argue that these barbaric methods of repression have been replaced by more effective forms of repression. I'd like to think that they are not looking at the long term history of humanity.This book, on the other hand, covers the long term very nicely , 17,000+ years of human history running from the near future to the total extermination of humanity by tens of thousands of enraged alien races. The 26 short stories that cover this era give you plenty to think about regarding the human race. Every possible human virtue and sin is in full display here as humanity strives to achieve total domination of the galaxy and then fritters away every last advantage in wanton stupidity and cruelty when we finally succeed. I'm not saying that it isn't reasonable, I'm just saying that I'd like to think that some faction of humanity would survive, that ever-adaptable humanity would find some way to avoid getting totally exterminated.My other major problem is that the stories are only loosely linked together. We get to meet hundreds of individuals, know them briefly, and then never see them again. This is a natural result of trying to tell 26 very different stores in about 300 pages but the result feels like reading an encyclopedia by reading one paragraph of one entry per letter of the alphabet. You are left with the feeling that there is an extraordinary amount of interesting material all around you that you are never going to be allowed to see. Very frustrating for me personally.If you feel that I'm trashing the book, please consider the fact that I gave it 3 stars.

B000EEHZ8W,Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series),,ALLS80O2PMOLL,Steve,0/0,3.0,1304121600,"Oh yeah, life goes on, long after the thrill of livin' is gone...","As anyone familiar with the work of Jon Mellencamp may have figured out already, this last (complete) entry in the outstanding Aubrey/Maturin saga reminded me of a different Jack and Diane.""Master and Commander"" (the first book in the series) was written almost three decades before ""Blue at the Mizzen"", and approximately 15 years of story time have passed as well. Either due to the aging of the author or of the characters (or perhaps of both), the thrill of living in their world is almost gone by the last couple of books; just a wisp of its former self.The late, great Patrick O'Brien was an immensely talented author. Most of his series crackles with historically accurate naval action that firmly pulls you into a long-ago time and place, a fascinating and intricate world that is totally gone. But even more importantly, his deep and nuanced characterizations made you really care about the people in the story, making the ""lulls"" between actions some of the most entertaining parts. Who could forget Jack's radiant joy at receiving his first command, or Stephen complaining, ""Jack, you have debauched my sloth!"", among dozens and dozens of other examples of wit and character that made a potentially dry topic come fully to life.In ""Blue at the Mizzen"", however, much of the joy of life and character and language and action that made so many readers love these books has faded to gray. The plot revolves around political and military maneuverings in Chile as Britain tries to quietly help the Spanish colony become independent. (This is no spoiler, as Jack and Stephen have been trying to make it over there for most of the last two books.) But neither of our main characters seem to give a fig about their mission. As a consequence, neither does the reader. That would be acceptable if the characters interacted and developed as they did throughout much of the series, but here they do neither. Jack is distant and morose, and Stephen spends his time pining for his new (and frankly unrealistic) love interest and riding aimlessly across the harsh local landscape, with little sign of their warm friendship to be seen.The characters are approaching middle age by this point, so it's unreasonable to expect them to behave as they did when the series began. They've been through too many victories and defeats and tragedies (both professionally and personally) to be the same people. But while forty year-olds don't generally grow and evolve at the same speed as younger men, they do change. O'Brien hints that perhaps now, when Jack and Stephen's long-held goals are finally within reach (raising a pennant) or already achieved (helping to defeat Napoleon), they might have started to realize that the journey was the thing after all, and that perhaps other goals are preferable now - a mid-life crisis, as it were. That seems to be a reasonable path for continuing the development of these wonderful characters, but O'Brien chose not to take it, and they're left as wooden caricatures of themselves.Their supporting cast doesn't help much. Inexplicably absent are many of their usual shipmates (Pullings, Mowett, Babbington, etc.), which is odd since it is mentioned more than once that sailors are desperate for work now that peace has come. And where is Jack's son Sam? When last they were in South America, he was quick to visit. Here, nobody seems to remember that he exists. Poor Rev. Martin, last spoken of when he sailed back for England many books ago, again doesn't even get a mention, much less a return appearance.Yes, a few newer characters are around, but they never take on much life. Dr. Jacob seems to be a more worldly replacement for Martin but never comes across as anything more than a 2-dimensional medical/intelligence aid to Stephen. Poll Skillings and Horatio Hansen have potential, but they aren't given much to do.Let me repeat, I absolutely love this series. The books flow from one to the next and have been called a single (20-volume!) historical novel, and the best I've ever read. I have read them all from beginning to end more than once and will certainly read them again. However, there's no getting around the fact that this last chapter is a disappointment.Near the end of the book, Aubrey receives a packet of letters from Sophie and tears up because he misses his family so much. It would have been much more satisfying, for both dear Jack and myself, if he would have been allowed to stop mucking around in South America and instead sail home to strike soundings in the channel of old England at last."

Bates ""jaydubyah""",4/6,5.0,1051142400,The Title Misleads,"While the state of comfortable numbness may be an appropriate description of USAF personnel doing long shifts on JSTARS or AWACS, that description does not apply to readers of Guy Jones' book with that title. Numb, maybe, over the first pages as Jones sets the stage a little slowly; but never comfortable and definitely not numb over the entire book.The promotional blurbs on the cover liken this book to the ""techno-thrillers"" of Tom Clancy and Dale Brown. I disagree. There is technology: JSTARS and AWACS do their job using very sophisticated technology, but the technology is pertinent to the story only as necessary for a thriller set in that environment. I liken this story more to the ""anxiety dreams"" of Robert Ludlum, but where Ludlum was the suave sophistication of Cary Grant, Jones creates a situation with more of the down-to-earth coping of Andy Griffith.Two college friends, different genders but with no sexual relationship (her doing, not his), go into ROTC and JSTARS/AWACS training together, and are assigned together for duty. Their on-the-job mentor and training officer is more than a little weird, and definitely on the outs with their commanding officer. They all end up on a mission where the fan starts being pelted. Their ensuing adventures, blundering through a Ludlumesque environment, end up exposing a major international plot. All's well that ends well, and the characters go off to live happily ever after-or do they?This is a great read, and I look forward to more-either the continuation of this story as set up very well by Jones, or something new. Based on this book, either will be welcome."

I found it very jumpy, whereas Ishmael would divulge his thoughts on many and varied subjects such as the nature of whales. Suddenly, you find yourself a month ahead of where you thought you were. The insigts on Ahab are masterful, however, as well as the symbolism. (Melville would kill us all.)

We plan on spending the first few months of our trip focusing on language learning, but we wanted a head start before we left. So we spent hours in bookstores this week looking for the right program. We settled on this Living Language set and we're happy with it.We put the first tape in on the way home from the bookstore. The tapes are ONLY Portuguese, which allows you to be saturated with the sounds of the language. The book lets you follow along with the tape and read the English translations. Once you've gone through a lesson on the tape and have read the lesson in the book, you can play the tape over and over again without the book to practice pronunciation and memorize the words and phrases.Perhaps what I liked best about this program is that you can use the book without the tape. The book is a real language textbook which can be read and used without listening to the tape. So, when you can't listen to a tape, you can still be reading dialogues, memorizing vocabulary, and learning grammar.The lessons are paced well, accomodating any level of learner. If you want to focus on one lesson you can do that easily. The lessons are broken up into 10 minute or so chunks. If you want to keep going and soak up several lessons at once you can do that, too.The vocabulary and grammar is immediately practical. From the very first dialogue you are learning everyday conversation. It's not just a &quot;phrase book&quot; however since the book also covers the grammar that is introduced in each dialogue.We're happy with Ultimate Portuguese, and I'm sure that it will be a worthwhile investment."

This book clearly explained both what a plot is, what it is not and what's necessary in order to plot your story successfully.

Even the characters have similar names. (ex: an Arwen the elf look-alike named Arya)He made very little effort to create an original plot, and many locations and characters have names/subplots/personalities that are so similar to their Tolkien counterpart that it is borderline ridiculous.I predict that the mentor of the main character that died, the Gandalf clone, will suddenly be resurrected in book two, ala' LOTR. I also predict the appearance of a talking tree, perhaps with a similar name to it's LOTR counterpart.We have an Arwen the elf character. (the elves even come from across the sea in this book)We have a Gimli the dwarf character, as well as the underground city of the dwarves.We of course have the Orcs (called Urgals in this book)as well as ""super-orcs"" called Kull (Ura-kai)There's Brom, Gandalf the wizard's cloneThere's even an Aragorn persona, who, like Aragorn, also happens to be the son of a mighty father who is fleeing his destiny.And we even have the evil magical tyrant, just like Sauron!This being said, the book itself is entertaining, especially if you haven't read anything by Tolkien.

So vivid were the settings and so well-liked (or, in some cases, well-disliked) were the characters that the story pulled me forward almost effortlessly.At nearly every bend of the river, I found myself marveling at what it must have been like to have lived in such an era, in so different a world. The loss of such an idyllic world is now near total, and perhaps a foretelling aspect of this loss may have been one of the intentions Twain had in his realistic upheavals into this otherwise romantic tale. Yet by providing aspects of both romanticism and realism he has allowed us to enjoy the heart of this ""innocent"" era and feel the jolts of connecting it to our real world (or rather, the real world at the time of its publication, but still felt today).I was truly touched by Huck's friendship and loyalty toward Jim, and found myself turning page after page in fear of Huck's giving in to societal pressures and doing what was viewed as the ""right"" thing to do-to turn Jim in as a runaway slave. And yet, as broken or uneducated as Huck's upbringing may have been, he triumphs in the true test of human spirit and honest, unbiased friendship.What a remarkable story!"

Witness ""sweat shops"" and the appalling treatment of some immigrant laborers. What strikes us as wrong about such exploitation is its fundamental drive to reduce human beings to mere ""things."" 19th century slavery followed this ideology, though on an institutionalized and far more ghastly level. In 1845, Former Maryland slave Frederick Douglass eloquently described what it was like to have his dignity ripped out from the roots. This, his first autobiography, should stand as a permanent reminder of what exploitation does to the exploited and also to the exploiters. Nobody wins. And as exploitation continues at home and abroad, we find that Frederick Douglass still has much to teach us.This short book chronicles Douglass' murky birth (his father's identity remains a mystery) to his eventual escape to New York City. Graphic depictions of slavery fill each chapter. More than that, Douglass offers reflections on how such events shaped his self-image. These passages evoke slavery's psychological brutality. They also help the reader stand in Douglass' coarse linen shoes, which considerably adds to the work's persuasive power. One such climax arrives in Chapter X, where Douglass lashes back at the infamous ""slave-breaker"" Mr. Covey. ""I did not hesitate to let it be known of me,"" Douglass writes with evident fury, ""that the white man who expected to succeed in whipping, must also succeed in killing me."" After one failed escape attempt, by the final chapter he finds his way to New York city. Since slavery was still very much a reality in 1845, he judiciously leaves out the details of his escape route. Then his fiance&eacute; appears as if out of nowhere, and with the help of abolitionists the newlyweds make their way to New Bedford. There he labors as a freeman until the anti-slavery movement appropriates him as one of their most eloquent spokespeople. Here he finally finds community and hope. The book's introduction outlines Douglass' life after 1845.Some of the most intriguing passages involve Douglass' reflections on the psychology of slavery. Keeping slaves busy, illiterate, full of self-reproach, and constantly on guard against physical punishment helped keep them in thier place. Not only that, Douglass describes his slave master's holiday tradition of forced drunkenness or surfeit to the point of sickness. He suggests that this sleight-of-hand attempted to give freedom an icky aftertaste. It was a trick. Give your slaves a taste of freedom (a week off) and make it the worst experience of their lives. Douglass even claims that, following such horrors, some slaves were almost relieved when they returned to their back breaking forced labor.Douglass ultimately escaped that hard labor, but he never forgot those he left behind. His back viciously scarred and his feet gashed from frost, he became a beacon for anti-slavery. This brief but passionately written autobiography will serve as a permanent reminder of just how horrible human beings can be to one another. Though its final chapter also relates some of humanity's good side. On both fronts, may this little book continue to inform the past as well as the future."
019251038X,Theogony and Works and Days (The World's Classics),,A1U0WO33TVDE9K,Wordsworth,5/7,4.0,1207872000,Thoreau Is Hesiod Reincarnated,"Many readers focus on the Theogony, which is the ancient Greeks Creation Story, and which Hesiod articulated masterfully. The descriptions of the battles between Zeus and the Titans made for vivid and stirring oration in the hands of a great speaker, as he boasts that he was by citing his awards. However, I was more intrigued by Works and Days. The advice of Hesiod was, indeed, sagacious: ""It is good to take from what is available, but sorrow to the heart to be wanting what is not."" And I liked this one: ""Right gets the upper hand over violence in the end."" At times he seemed like Thoreau incarnate preaching industry and self-reliance from his little cabin on Walden Pond: ""Avoid shady seats and sleeping til sunrise at harvest time, when the sun parches the skin. At that time get on with it and gather home the harvest, rising before dawn so that your livelihood may be assured. For the morning accounts for a third of the work."" Or this one: ""For property is as life to wretched mortals."" Some of his advice is quaint, as when a man should take a wife. The thing of it is that so much of what passed for wisdom in ancient days would still pass for it today."

0804722145,"The Transformation of Intimacy: Sexuality, Love, and Eroticism in Modern Societies",17.1,A3L5TSL9F9BEQH,J. Held,3/4,5.0,1230422400,Relationships,"This book is primarily about relationships and how sexuality applies but specifically what Giddens terms a ""pure relationship"". This type of relationship exists between two individuals irregardless of gender. Characteristics of this relationship will parallel those of a democracy in that both individuals will have rights and duties but will be equal. Relationships will become a contract between two individuals emphasizing a confluent love rather than one that is dominated by economic and political controlling behaviors resulting in gender inequality associated with relationships within the realm of marriage. Pure relationships will be formed with set parameters according to each individual's needs and desires. Additionally it will not be a relationship ""until death do us part"" but rather one that states ""until we no longer agree to be"". Sex will be one aspect of this relationship that can be negotiated as a rite but not as a duty and will be completely separate to that of the relationship. It will no longer be considered a right of the husband but a means for each individual to acquire pleasure.Hedonism will be widely accepted in the future according to Giddens. In fact he expects Hedonistic Consumerism to replace capitalistic productivity as the driving force behind economics and politics. The consumerism of sex is proof to this phenomenon. During the industrial age one had to work long and hard to be productive while sexual pleasures were considered detrimental to those efforts. The additional disposable time one has earned through an incredible increase in production via the informational age has reversed this view that sexual pleasure is counterproductive. A sexual transformation is at hand.Giddens discusses Freud in detail concerning the phallus and penis envy. He is somewhat critical of Freud but applies these concepts to explain how and why man and woman develop their sexual identity and how this identity explains society. Men develop a masculine identity while women femininity. It is this masculinity that has plagued man for it is a lacking identity. It lacks intimacy and so it desires what it lacks. Women have intimacy but lack independence and autonomy. At some point in modernity women have emerged from their role of mother to join society as an equal of man. This has led to a subconscious effort by man to control women. Man sees this emergence as a threat and as a result responds at times with violence. Rape is the modern context is an act of control or punishment. Rape in pre-modern times usually occurred in the fringes of society such as the frontiers lacking authority, during wars by soldiers, etc. but not as punishment or controlling measure but for the sheer act of sexual pleasure. Rape, according to Giddens, in today's society is committed by loyalists of a day gone by where men ruled the roost. It is their way of being deviant.I think if Giddens is correct we will witness a future in which one will not be viewed as a ""manly man"" or a ""girly girl"" but as an individual without any gender specific roles to portray. This reminds me of Foucault's view on Greek sexuality. The Greeks did not see beauty in the form of a woman or a man but rather saw beauty in a being irregardless of their gender. Bi-sexuality or homosexuality did not exist for they did not recognize the distinction. Giddens celebrates the lifestyles that are emerging in today's world. These lifestyles are in fact not only emerging but are thriving so I would have a hard time disputing his conclusions that sexual emancipation is at hand. One only has to visit any urban city of significant population to witness first-hand the numerous gay bars and nightclubs, swinger's clubs, and BDSM clubs that have opened in recent years. While I gained some insight into what is happening in society concerning sexuality, I am unsure if I should be confused or concerned."
0449233413,Dragonwyck,,AC9B29BXXWJHD,K. Huff,16/17,4.0,1147996800,Sinister,"The premise of Dragonwick seems very much like that of Jane Eyre--a young woman goes tot he house of a very wealthy man to teac his child and ends up falling in love with him. However, this book adds a completely new dimension to this story outline. The main character is absolutely nothing like the demure, humble Jane, and everyone else is sinister in a way that Charlotte Bronte's characters never could have been.The book begins in 1844 and ends in 1849, covering the land rent problems the landlords face, the Astor Place Massacre, and the far-away wars in Texas. The Mid-Atlantic is peopled solely with those of old Dutch ancestry, and cattle still live in downtown Manhattan, which is more farmland than city real estate in the mid-19th century.Miranda Welles is the daughter of a poor farmer from Connecticuit. One day the family recieves a letter from a wealthy New York cousin of theirs, the Van Ryns. Nicholas Van Ryn, looking for a governess for his six-year-old daughter, asks the Welles family if they might be able to spare one of their daughters for the task. And so Miranda goes to New York, a place much finer than she had ever expected it to be. Van Ryn is of old Dutch stock that came to America two hundred years before, and are landlords and adherents to the old way of living, a way that is quickly disintegrating.Upon arriving at the family estate, Dragonwyck, Miranda meets the Lady of the House, the corpulent Johanna. It is clear that Nicholas is no longer in love with his wife, and his attentions turn toward Miranda, who is his cousin by marriage. The book has an omniscient narrator, with intervals in which various minor characters interject their thoughts and feelings (the French Count's are the funniest and most astute). Vvery quickly, Miranda notices something discomfitting about the house, despite its beauty. All the members of the blood line of the Van Ryn family can hear the ghostly cries of one of their ancestors, and Miranda can feel that ancestor's presence in several areas of the house.Upon Johanna Van Ryn's death, under suspicious circumstances, Nicholas immediately proposes to Miranda, though they must wait a year to allow for mourning. Nicholas comes back to her exactly as promised, and they marry. But there is something not quite right with their marriage; Nicholas has a tendency to turn away from distressing situations--or he faces them and does something foolish. It is clear that Nicholas's moments of tenderness towards his new wife become few and far between.Added into the mix is a country doctor, Jefferson Turner. A local man who supports those who are trying to overthrow the manorial system, Jeff has an intense dislike, yet an admiration for Van Ryn. He also develops feelings towards Miranda, who increase as the book progresses.Oone thing that I liked about the book was the number of contemporary authors who had cameos. We meet, briefly, Fenimore Cooper, Herman Melville, and Edgar Allan Poe. By the way, it is from the latter that Nicholas acquires a foul habit that will affect him significantly later on in the book. In sum, I thought this was a wonderful book, though not on the same level as Katherine and Green Ddrakness. Nevertheless, its not difficult to see why Seton's books are being reprinted; they're truly wonderful novels in the gothic style."
B000NPEWHE,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,,,,0/0,3.0,989971200,Harry Poter- The Chamber of Secrets,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, by J.K. Rowlings, is the second of the four books in the Harry Potter series. Although it followed closely to the others in characters and themes, the way J.K Rowlings wrote her story did not catch my interest as the others did.Chamber of Secrets begins as the others do, describing Harry Potter's past and his life with his non-wizard family that hates him. His parents, who were wizards, were killed when he was just a baby and he life was miraculously spared. His aunt and uncle raised him, but they hated him because he was a wizard just like his parents. He led a miserable life until one day he received a letter inviting him to attend Hogwart's, a school for wizards in training. Harry is a very famous student; all the children know how an evil wizard killed his parents. This often puts Harry in the spotlight.In Chamber of Secrets, someone is putting a curse on many students and turning them into stone. There are a number of suspects, and one of them is Harry. He seems to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. Although most people love and respect Harry, there is a student, Draco Malfoy that hates Harry. He tries to do whatever it takes to hurt Harry and blame him for all the accidents that are happening around Hogwarts. He even manages to convince most of the students that Harry is the one turning everyone to stone.Most of the book is about the accidents that happen at Hogwarts, Harry and his friends and a new teacher at the school. Although Harry wants to prove to everyone that he isn't the one behind all the accidents, this part of the storyline doesn't begin until the end. In the other Harry Potter books, the final adventure is build up throughout the story and that is why they are page-turners. In this volume, the beginning of the final scene starts at the very end and is solved quickly. Just as the book picks up, it ends almost abruptly.This volume, out of the four Harry Potter books, was my least favorite. It seems like J.K Rowlings was so excited about the fame of the first one that Chamber of Secrets was written quickly. In the first of the series and the ones after this one, there are many more details, both in the characters personalities, each of their storylines, and in the plot itself.Chamber's of Secrets is an enjoyable book. It is not as suspenseful and charming as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, the first of the Harry Potter series. It is worth reading though if one wishes. One does not have to read Chamber of Secrets to understand the third and fourth books in the Harry Potter series."

9997413563,The Earl,,A5CA9579GD7HJ,Bob Jarvis,1/2,3.0,1325808000,Great content.. but flawed!,"Cecilia Holland is a historical fiction writer in the style of Penman and Chadwick. Characters are drawn and developed carefully and realistically, whether fictional or real. Reader cares for the hero's wellbeing, and almost boos when the bad guys appear, such is the strength of these characterisations. Historically she is spot on, setting all the action amongst the real proceedings, intrigues and political manouvring that took place at the time. I also really enjoy her descriptions of conflict, battles, etc; vivid and violent!Her descriptions of 12th century life, both the noble and the serfs is vividly presented. In this book we see the horse riding Normans (Fulk, Thierry, etc.) compared with the horse cleaning Saxons (Ulf, Edwyr, etc.) and the dreadful, superior attitudes that the Normans hold towards the Saxons, just some 70/80 years after the 1066 conquest. ""I've never actually spoken to a serf, apart from asking directions"" says one noble. ""You should give him a beating for his attitude"" says another.Holland's descriptions show the immense richness of the Norman way of life, food, clothes, jewels and privilege. A life of luxury and wealth that is strikingly juxtaposed against the lives of the serfdom of the land, grindingly poor, filthy, worked to death and generally abused. As a Brit, I certainly hope my Great-Grandparents were of Norman stock or they would really have suffered.So much in the book to enjoy, so why only a three star rating? It was so short! I was just starting to enjoy all the above, rooting for my favourites and biting my lip at the nefarious schemes of the others, when the book just ended. It was as if the publisher had poked his head round he door and said ""I must have the manuscript for printing by lunch-time Cecelia dear, no excuses."" The point in history was just coming to a boil, everyone was in position to wreak havoc with one another and the author proceeds to hurriedly kill off just one of the evil-doers and write ""The End"". Not even a postscript to tell us all how the other principle (real) characters finally ended up, Just ""The end!"" Highly unsatisfactory.The other problem is the usual Kindle crap; typos! Almost every page has one. In this case the errors are mainly letters missing form simple words. ""Them"" becomes """"the"""" and ""this"" appears as ""his"". It sometimes gives sentences that make no sense at all and one has to reread the sentence to spot the error. By the time the book ended I felt like I had been in an English language test. Sadly, this sort of rubbish is terribly common in Kindle-land and I for one am heartily sick of it.This book had the potential for greatness in it and it was frittered away. Sad!"

B000OW4E7O,Separate Peace,,,,1/1,5.0,1014940800,Life's Little Difficulties,"A Review by CraigA story about a young man named Gene Forrester who went to a boarding school called Devon in during WW II. The book starts out in the summer session where most people have left and gone home, but Gene, his best friend Phineaus, and some other guys are left. They were always inventing games and sports and clubs to pass the time. Like the Super Suicide Club of the Summer Session, where they met out at this big tree to jump off into a river. One of the meetings, Gene and Finny both decide to jump off into the river together. When they get to the top, Gene, with out thinking, wobbles the branch, which they both were standing. Phineaus falls off the tree and falls to the shore shattering his leg. The doctor said that he would walk again but could no longer play sports. Gene was stunned, how could he have done that? He spent the next few weeks in deep thought about his actions until Finny returned to school. Nobody knew quit what happened so they didn't blame Gene. After that, Finny decided to train Gene for the 1944 Olympics. A few months' pasts and life went on, but rumors were going around about Finny's accident. So, to get to the bottom of it, Brinker decided to have a sort of a trial in which a boy named Leper had seen Gene wobble the ledge causing Phineaus to fall. Finny was shocked, he left crying and on his way out he fell down some stares breaking his leg again, from there, the story takes a turn but I can't reveal the ending you'll just have to read it.This story was one of the best books I've ever read. It was full of action, and it described everything in great detail. This book made me think more than any other book has ever done. It's a really great story of the life of a high school student in 1942, and it was interesting to see their ideas of the war.I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who just likes a good book. It will defiantly put you through a whole range of emotions."

B0000ALQ0O,Kushiel's Dart,,A16ZBKNB7CE5RQ,"Cheriphim ""~}:)i(:{~""",11/22,2.0,1304640000,"Well-written, but poorly developed from a psychological perspective.","**I intend to warn readers that if you find sexual abuse disturbing, there are several scenes described in this book that will be very off-putting.**Since the book was presented as the tale of someone who actually finds pain pleasurable, I began reading it tentatively at the bequest of a good friend of mine who really enjoyed the story, and gave me her copy to peruse. Halfway through, I seriously regretted ever opening this book. I finished it anyway, not sure if I will read any more of them. I enjoy the eloquent writing style, but find it hard to reconcile with the macabre nature of the story itself.That aside, the one and only issue I find with this book, is that Carey is inconsistent with the psychological profile and development of her main character, who supposedly loves feeling pain(--only not really).Now, keep in mind that although very, very rare, there is actual recognized medical condition(s) that cause people to either feel no pain, or to associate pain with pleasure... But from a psychological point (as in, NOT having a medically-defined origination in an abnormal nervous system, but instead a purely mental reaction), there are only unhealthy methods of associating pain with pleasure, not the least of which is the direct result of prolonged neglect and abuse.Carey at first seems to be presenting her ""anguissette"" as the former, a rare person who has NOT been conditioned to associate pain with pleasure, but who does so naturally, automatically. This would have been truly interesting.However. As her character shows more and more of her inner thoughts and reactions to the sadistic sex she is subjected to in the book, it becomes blatantly obvious that it is the latter, and isn't a genuine anguissette at all, but a victim of unfortunate chance and circumstance, who is trying to cope the only way she knows how.Carey's heroine has masochistic tendencies which are the direct result of a childhood of emotional traumas: Abandonment; being sold into slavery at the age of six; the consequent sexual conditioning of being raised by others who are indentured consorts; combined with a deep inner sense of inadequacy. Her low self-esteem is directly due to her one physical flaw: A red splotch in her left eye, marking her as less beautiful than all of her physically flawless peers, and which she is told as a child is the mark of the God Kushiel, who has chosen to doom her to a life of pain and suffering.It reads like a classic case study of a self-destructive, objectified, abused adolescent in foster care. Add in the fact that she is being trained as a spy, so that she will allow herself to be abused and debased in order to gather information for her ""owner"" and... its just so icky.Since her only alternative is being kicked out and living on the streets, or worse, it seems to be a situation of obvious coercion, which would be considered criminal by today's standards.Frankly, I love erotica, but I have no desire to read about the sexual exploitation and abuse of anyone, least of all a young girl who has been sold into sexual slavery long before she would have had the psychological maturity to decide if this was the life she actually wanted for herself. (As if ""slaves"" have any choice? Seriously.)This is no elegant portrayal of Courtesans or self-possessed Companions, but rather a tale of a young girl being pimped out to a rival gang of politicians, along with her foster-brother, by their ""protective"" foster-father. She supposedly can choose to decline any of the ""patrons"" her master chooses for her, but is NOT allowed to choose any sexual partners for herself. Yes, Freud would have a field day.Given Carey's actual degree in psychology, it is hard to determine if she is trying to make a convoluted, cynical point regarding the hidden dangers in these practices, or if she is actually exploring her own dark fantasies, or something else entirely. Either way, to anyone with any degree of empathy, it is a very disturbing situation being described, sometimes in great detail.Additionally, Carey mentions the children being raised/fostered in the Mandrake and Valerian pleasure houses--dedicated to Sadism and Masochism respectively--they are catatonic, fear-ridden, and broken. These are young children, we're talking preschool & kindergarten aged. Carey is careful to say that the pleasure houses don't actually use them, since they do not start sex-training until the ripe old age of 10, and each house wants to secure a high Virgin Price at the age of 16, but whatever these young children are witnessing, Carey is clever enough to suggest.Again, very disturbing.There is something quite unenlightened in this Utopian fantasy world.""Love As Thou Wilt"" would be fine and perfect, if it were mutual, and if that was really what was taking place, but it isn't. Raising and training someone from childhood to be a sexual plaything, to ""Be Used As They Wilt"" is VERY different than embracing sexuality from a healthy, albeit adventurous, place. Pointedly, rape by its very definition is NOT mutual. And a child is incapable of making that kind of choice, without being manipulated and exploited, which is exactly what happens in this story, again and again.If the main character was truly an anguissette, she would enjoy every minute of what is done to her, including being sold into slavery a second time and raped by her new owner--instead of the shame, humiliation, guilt, and hatred which she experiences in these situations. These are normal feelings under such circumstances; there is nothing unusual, nothing defining of an anguissette herein. A healthy masochist is pretty hard to find, but they do exist. I would presume that is what Carey was ""trying"" to portray... It really seems to me that Carey just doesn't quite understand this type of person--and projects these negative emotions into a character she has no idea how to authentically express on paper. So instead of depicting someone who enjoys rough sex, she is only describing a young girl who is forcing herself to deal with circumstances beyond her own control, and resenting it.I am no prude, and would have found it interesting to explore this sexually open society right alongside Carey, if she had managed to actually present such a thing.But this book was ridiculously inept at portraying healthy sexual proclivity, no matter how ""alternative"" its style. Instead, it presents a cornucopia of human sexual failings, combined with yet another system of dogma excusing them and trying to justify them, without actually doing them any justice.Utterly disappointing, and left me feeling like I had just witnessed crimes, not mutual acts of sexual fulfillment."

This careful background research makes this book (as her previous &quot;Girl with Pearl Earring&quot; and &quot;Falling Angels&quot;) educating as well as entertaining. The book is a very easy read and the different narrating voices add to its appeal and to the reader's ability to feel for the characters. The book cover (in the copy I hold) is splendid, portraying a detail of &quot;Portrait of a girl&quot; attributed to Domenico Ghirlanaio and a detail of the &quot;The Lady and the Unicorn&quot; tapestry, both of which are so wonderful to look at, that for me it added yet another important layer to the reading. &quot;Portrait of a girl&quot; especially comes to mind in the beginning pages when we meet Claude Le Viste through Nicolas eyes. It should be noted however, that although Tracy Chevalier does present an interesting, captivating tale, it sometimes withdraws into a too romantic, soap opera kind of novel. This reader was willing to accept such writing as there is a solid substance behind it and the writer knows where she wants to take you. Nevertheless, I did not feel that the feministic messages were in place (re Christine Du Sablon and other female characters) and not always appropriate to the period's thinking. Same criticism can be said about the fact that the author feels the need to &quot;resolve&quot; the problems/issues of every character and even gives us an epilogue with details about the future of each figure. Although this is &quot;nice to have&quot; I did not feel it was really necessary and in a way lowered the perception of this book as a more serious work."

It is about a twenty-something guy who is married with a son. He used to be a star basketball player and now, caught in a love-hate marriage and a dead-end job, the banality and drabness of his life is getting to him.Interesting so far, isn't it ? But Updike makes a mess of a promising plot. Here is what happens....our hero decides to run away from his family, his job, his friends, everything......he gets into the car and intends to drive someplace far away. Ah, one thinks....a great American road trip is in order.....but no such luck. He returns to his town the same night, settles down with a prostitute, and when his wife is about to deliver a baby, goes back to her, again gets tired of her, goes back to the prostitute but is not sure if he should abandon his wife, and runs again.Sounds stupid ? It is.And the writing is tortuously slow and maddeningly muddy. It seems that Updike wrote this novel to please his literature teachers who would prefer form over substance. He writes these long paragraphs without punctuation apparently trying to describe and mirror the random thoughts of his characters....trying to evoke a stream-of-consciousness feel about these passages but fails miserably. Such passages only make the book even more tedious and ambiguous.Here is an example of what has been called Updike's 'Crystal-clear prose:'""And further inside, so ghostly it comes to him last, hangs a jagged cloud, the star of an explosion, whose center is uncertain in refraction but whose arms fly from the core of pallor as straight as long eraser-marks diagonally into all planes of the cube.""And if you guys want an example of Updike's cute punctuation, here are the last few words of the novel:""....he runs. Ah: runs. Runs.""Updike, like all bad literary-wannabe authors, keep describing the weather, the food, the scenery with great, tear-inducing meticulousness but doesn't develop his stereotypical characters even one bit during the course of the book.This garbage is not worth anybody's time and is a good example of why such so-called literature doesn't interest the masses.

Why haven't we heard about it? The Russians didn't want to admit that their submarine had sunk a refugee ship (although it was still painted like a military ship).

It's an outstanding reference book. The author's mastery of Spanish is rather humbling, but he is able to convey a great deal of knowledge using a writing style that is both relaxed and very enjoyable to read.This book is a sort of Spanish-to-English dictionary, but it doesn't simply list English equivalents of a Spanish word the way a regular bilingual dictionary does. It goes into a discussion of the word in question and explains the little nuances and shades in meaning in a way that most dictionaries never come close to doing. The definitions given include examples and anecdotes that put the words in context to help the reader better grasp their meaning. When necessary, the author is always careful to point out the various meanings a particular word might have in different parts of the Spanish-speaking world. Further, the author is not afraid to list &quot;off-color&quot; or vulgar words in an attempt to save the reader from unwittingly making a fool of him or herself by using the wrong word in the wrong part of the world.My only &quot;complaint&quot; is that this book isn't even longer and more exhaustive than it is (it's 303 pages), although the book's relative brevity makes it easier to completely read and digest. Still, a second volume that picks up where this one leaves off would be wonderful to have.I've lived in South America and have a four-year college degree in Spanish, yet I still learn something new (or relearn something I've forgotten) every time I pick up this book. Students of all ability levels from beginning to very advanced will benefit from this work. That said, I think most beginning students will already have enough on their hands with learning the nuts and bolts of Spanish grammar and acquiring a basic vocabulary. For that reason, I tend to think that a book of this type is better suited for intermediate and up students. Along with a good dictionary like the Larousse Gran Diccionario, this is a must-own reference book for any serious student of the Spanish language."

This is no Jane Eyre and should never be compared, even though frequently I have heard the outlandish comparision. In the novel Anne Bronte introduces the reader to real women, no Jane Eyre type who's only accomplishment was living one her own. No Anne Bronte's main character leaves her husband ( something which was unheard of at that time) and lives alone with her son. Bronte also changes the form of the classic novel by speaking as from both a man and woman's perspective. The strengh of the novel is the fact that Bronte's starting narrator is a man then a woman and once again a man. She takes a risk which last over 100 pages when the tenant (woman) becomes the narrator as the man narrator reads her journal. This novel tell a tale of a woman who breaks free from society to save herself. Anne Bronte has become the forgotton sister, though her works were never as sucessful as her to sisters, I feel that her risk taking ability, along with her ability to tell a great story makes her the best out of the three. I would also tell everyone to read her other novel Agnes Grey for it to is a great story. I only wish that Anne Bronte had left more works for her loyal fans as myself to read."

Nagy ""revreader""",2/2,5.0,1231632000,psycho-sexual history of fascist men. Classic,"Klaus Theweleit's two-volume study, Male Fantasies (Meinnerphantasien), might be described as a psycho-sexual history of fascist male desire in Germany from its inception in the aftermath of World War 1. Theweleit seems especially informed by the psychoanalytic paradigms of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, insofar as their work, like Theweleit's, consistently emphasises the productive force of fantasy or the unconscious in relation to the material world and its sociopolitical formations. Stylistically, Male Fantasies is made up of textual fragments -- diaries, memoirs, letters, works of fiction, visual art -- which, although historically and culturally specific, are not presented in a stable or overarching historical, narrative or theoretical framework. Instead, Theweleit's text suggests affinities or connotations between symbolic and bodily practices, material production and fantasy, which are not limited to a given historical moment, but which, arguably, maintain both resonance and relevance today.According to Theweleit it is through the body, and the discourses of the body, that fascist desires (and anxieties) take their sociopolitical formations and effects. The threat to the soldier male of bodily dissolution and collapse is played out, or in psychoanalytic terms, projected onto the bodies of its others -- notably those of women, Jews, communists, the proletariat, homosexuals, and other marginalised groups, who can thus be subjected and annihilated in fantasy -- if not in reality. The extracts reprinted here illustrate the brutalising symbolic practices and fantasies by which the soldier male's 'armoured' body is structured and impelled to action."

You can and will learn secrets that you would have never thought of , secrets that before Ishi, had been so completely forgotten that Dr. Pope had to reintroduce the techniques to other Native American Tribes.I am not a hunter, I have never used a bow but I have a great love of the outdoors and I loved every moment of this book. I feel like I have learned enough to supply food for myself and my family if the need arises. Along with the wealth of information I gained by reading Hunting with the bow and arrow, I feel that I have also stood witness to a wonderful adventure and lived through the excitement of the hunt.Even though, once again, there are no diagrams or photos with the Kindle edition, Hunting with the Bow and Arrow will never be removed from my Kindle."

Thus, it is very easy to understand his jumping on the bandwagon to take advantage of the interest in various theories postulated in The Da Vinci Code. Most of the interviews with various experts in the field and excerpts from their works were extremely interesting, although Burstein's attempt to give a voice to people not interested in the debunking of the sham of Christianity was tedious. The fact that he included and gave equal veracity to his son's (very boring) high school essay is evidence of the intellectual stature of Dan Burstein. While I can appreciate the interest of most of the articles and interviews he collected, I cannot give any credence to Dan Burstein, who believes himself capable of coming to scholarly conclusions about the mysteries behind The Da Vinci Code. His statements on recent television programs show that he is trying to take advantage of the sensationalism, while at the same time pacifying people on both sides of the question. Obviously, offending either side would make it more difficult to do what he is really about, making money. Dan Burstein should leave patristics to the authorities on patristics. As a self-described authority on ""the mysteries behind The Da Vinci Code,"" he comes across as ludicrous. Save your money for the books by the real scholars."

Adding to the captain's incentive is that he has inherited a run down Castle, Dunmoral. No longer the Dragon, Douglas Moncrief seeks respectability as expected of a Laird.Princess Rowena of Hartzburg, a small principality that is in trouble from rebels, needs a warrior scoundrel. She comes to obtain the services of the notorious Dragon. Instead she gets the aristocratic Douglas. As he acts more like a gentleman, she becomes more shrewish over his behavior. However, neither one can stop the love that grows between them. The only thing holding them back is how Rowena reacts to Douglas' true colors.DELIGHT is a humorously warm historical romance that shows the daring talent of an adept writer to breathe a fresh perspective into an era that has been done to the bone. The story line is fast-paced, filled with action, and loaded with jocular ripostes. The warmth of the characters is a Jillian Hunter trademark which turns her novels into fairy tales that arouse the interest of the sub-genre audience.Harriet Klausner"

It is really sad. I read it with tears because back in 1969, my parents took my sister and I to visit Calumet, and I was extremely impressed as a horse-loving (and owning)teenager.One of the highlights of the trip was seeing 29 year old Citation. We also saw Needles, another Kentucky Derby winner who was standing at Calumet at the time, and I'm surprised no mention was made of him.The same day, we visited Leslie Comb ll's Spendthrift Farm that actually went belly up before Calumet, but not that long before.There, we saw Nashua, Swaps, Creme dela Creme, Sword Dancer, and Gallant Man. The lesson is that these are living, breathing creatures, not meant to be portfolios or their welfare put at the whim of human greed and avarice.I read the book wishing I could slap Lundy full in the face, and to this day, I fully believe he had a hand in Alydar's death because it would be to Lundy's advantage at the time to collect on the insurance. I am surprised that the Lloyd's of London didn't require a more extensive investigation before the payout was made, but they probably still believed in Calumet's peerless reputation, and a part of them didn't want to imagine anyone at Calumet would do anything like this. They just didn't know Lundy. That's too bad. I hope Lundy lives the rest of his life in regret, poverty, and pariahhood."

Schnell,0/0,4.0,1013644800,Was it oppression or selfishness?,"I have been to the breaking point occasionally in my life, but did I ever seriously consider leaving it all behind? No. I can except the fact Delia may have felt the need to leave her husband, but even after I read the entire novel, I still could not fathom walking away from my children. Whatever horrible persecution Delia was feeling in her life, a mother worthy of her children would not leave them.Delia needed to establish her self worth and to find out what she really wanted for herself-without someone else telling her what she really wanted. I believe the way she discovered these things was selfish and held no regard for anyone's feelings except her own. So, her teenaged children didn't appreciate her anymore...Oh, like this is something new in life. Deal with it, get a hobby if you're feeling oppressed, but to abandon your family is the coward's way to deal with your problems. Delia finally decided her life was worth coming back to, but she needs to make changes or the next family vacation, she might be taking another infamous walk down the beach.Although I did not place Delia in high regard as a mother, she did a great job of establishing a new life for herself. I'm glad she decided to go back to her family, but I found myself feeling bad for Joel and Noah, as well.I enjoyed this novel, but continued to want more in respect to character development. I wondered about the intimate details of Delia's father, Sam, Joel, Noah and even Adrian. I felt Tyler left her readers too much in the dark, maybe purposefully.All in all, even though Delia's journey didn't seem to prove much, the novel itself was entertaining and worthwhile to read."

Kerouac introduces characters by telling snippet stories about the person. Rather than focusing on looks or relationships, he looks at what makes them unique and interesting in the world.The book has some slow parts. When the fascinating people story descriptions slowed down around p.250, I cruised through the next 100 pages until he brought the adventure back. Because it has a biographical feel, though it doesn't claim to be one, the pace represents the true pace of life.If you've ever longed for the open road, dreamed of talking to fascinating people of all walks of life, or just wanted to discover how to live with nothing at a moments notice, read this book.

019275078X,Tales from China (Oxford Myths and Legends),,A291Q46ZTQD2HK,K. T. Ong,25/25,4.0,1103241600,"Good, but...","This book is actually a reprint of CHINESE MYTHS AND FANTASIES by the same author, with different illustrations. It is divided into three sections: 'The Conquerors of Chaos', the shortest section, dealing with the most primordial deities and heroes in Chinese mythology and their struggles in the establishment and maintenance of cosmic order; 'Fairies, Ghosts and Others', basically a selection of folktales; and finally 'The Revolt of the Demons', actually a single long story divided into six separate, shorter ones.The strong point of this book lies in the style of the author's prose. Birch is able to write in a way that is simple and elegant yet lends a magical feel to the stories so that they read like good mythical narratives. You get that archaic flavor. (Certain parts of some stories seem over-summarised, though; they could have been fleshed out with slightly richer descriptions.)A very unsatisfactory aspect of the book, from the point of view of a contemporary heir of the Chinese tradition, is that (except for the first section, 'The Conquerors of Chaos') it leaves out many (indeed most) of the most important and representative of Chinese myths and legends. The Eight Immortals, the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl, the Monkey God who wreaked havoc in Heaven and later escorted the Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang (a.k.a. Tripitaka) to India, Chang'e the lady who flew to the moon after stealing the elixir or immortality from her husband... All are missing. The stories found in this volume are enjoyable in their own right, but they are relatively obscure. I would have left out most of them and put the abovementioned stories in their place.Another shortcoming is that the book does not offer at least some brief introductory note regarding the stories and their sources. Neither is there a pronunciation guide. You do find introductory notes and pronunciation guides in TALES FROM INDIA and TALES OF THE NORSE GODS, both from the same series, so I can't understand this omission from the present volume.Finally, I think the cover design just looks a bit too goofy. David O'Connor could have done a better job researching traditional Chinese design motifs a bit more.(Note: at the time this review is written (17th Dec '04), it is possible to get a NEW copy of this book from Barnes and Noble.)"

He is a Lt. Detective on limited duty due to a bullet he took to his knee and has decided after an evening out to walk home in order to get some exercise to it when, in a case of being in either the right place at the right time, or wrong place at the wrong time, he witnesses a woman falling from a building. It turns out to be a rather famous TV personality who was scheduled to take her place as a co-anchor on a prestigious network the next night. When he arrives at her apartment he hears someone leaving it rapidly, but when he gives chase his knee gives out and he loses the person he was chasing. However, what is set up to be a relatively open-and-shut homicide case is quickly muddied by the arrival of a freelance journalist who got footage of her at the scene showing that she was still alive when put in the ambulance, by her diary that shows that she was severely depressed at times, and then by her disappearance - no body, no crime. Barrington's obsession with finding out the truth in this case, as opposed to just finding someone to stick with the crime, quickly puts him at odds with the rest of the department (with whom he never fit in all that well to begin with) and he soon finds himself railroaded out on a medical disability retirement. However, he has a background in law and decides to take the bar exam and set himself up that way. The twists just keep on coming as taxi drivers start getting murdered around the city, and Barrington begins to get notes purportedly from the missing star.I started to read these books out of order when I picked up ""Reckless Abandon"" and then ""Two Dollar Bill,"" then I decided to hold off until I put my hands on all of them and start at the beginning; I'm glad I have, because I can now look forward to a long line of these most excellent thrillers. Woods knows how to put together a great mystery and keep it exciting!"

The book was a sort of prophesy by Bradbury in the 50's, warning Americans of what may happen to young minds today and in the future, if we allow television to blindly influence our lives and society. I view the &quot;families&quot; as the television, dangerous because it delivers suggestions to the brain, before one can approach it with analytical thought. Visual suggestions can alter your way of perceiving life if one doesn't approach it with question and analysis. Books, however, allow one to analyze and reason out ideas for themselves. This is a point clearly illustrated in Brabury's book, the importance of reading; the enhancers of free thought. Once again, I strongly recommend Fahrenheit 451 be read, particularly by the youth of the 90's and the millenium. This is definitely a book needed in our age of runaway technology."

Three close friends in high school went on one final adventure together. They never realized the adventure would soon turn into a life-threatening event that would change them all forever and create an unbreakable bond to each other. One of these men was Brett. And this is his story.A promise made many years ago seems silly when you consider the girl was only five years old, but Rebekah just couldn't shake the fact that Brett should still hold himself to that promise. When Dr. Brett walks back into her life again after all those years, she has high hopes that he has returned to take over the clinic from the doctor who was now old and not able to keep up with the patient's needs. But Brett announces that he is not returning. The last thing he wanted was to be known as a ""horse and buggy"" doctor.Unfortunately, things aren't always as they seem. Brett lost his Fellowship after making a moral decision. The doctor may have some serious health issues. And after tragedy struck Rebekah's family, Rebekah is practically raising her niece while her brother is away (more on that story in book 4). Also, Alex, Brett and Mitch's friend, refuses to get help with his injury incurred during a plane crash. Brett must find some way to help is friend while also trying to convince the Doc to understand what would be best for the clinic.I remember reading this book a long time ago, and I was so excited when I finally got to this book on my list. Though I remembered bits and pieces, not enough to spoil any surprises the author had in store. Incidently, what I thought was going to be the conclusion wasn't exactly right, though perhaps the even played a part in the conclusion.Remember Mitch and Anne from the first story? Well, we get details on their engagement and wedding in this story. Though you can read this book without the first, I recommend reading the first book,Desperately Seeking Dad (Hometown Heroes)first.

It is a most beautiful book.It's rare that something that looks at first glance like a &quot;coffee table book&quot; that should be admired largely for its pictures but that also contains such a thoughtful and illuminating text.There is no other book that shows as clearly how the Shakers connected practicality and simplicity with elegance and harmony of design. The photographs are subtle, understated but quite lovely to linger over.It's easy to dismiss the Shakers as a fringe group, and few up us would embrace their doctrine of celibacy. But June Sprigg documents the appeal of their fundamental values: Do all your work as if it was to last for 1,000 years, but live your life as if you knew that the Judgment Day was coming tomorrow. Her ability to articulate this apparent paradox makes this a spiritually moving book.Buy it as a gift for anyone interested in design, or with a serious interest in religion.

So when Shelters of Stone came out I was pleasantly surprised! I read the free preview on Kindle, and although not particularly impressed, I decided to read the book, figuring that it would be the last in the series, and string together all the loose ends.I slogged thorough over 700 pages of drivel, only to have the story end in such predictable disappointment.It is obvious that the series will continue for multiple more books, rehashing old stories and introducing more boring characters in an attempt to make more money for the author. My time is too precious to waste any more time on these characters. I have no intention to follow this series further, as it is obvious from the last several books that nothing new will change.

0613912128,Ebay Hacks,,AG35NEEFCMQVR,W Boudville,110/118,4.0,1065139200,"Not Bad, But Omits Important Tips","Tired of facile books on eBay? (You know, something like 'Moron's Guide to eBay'.) Are you wavering on going to buy or sell on it, never having done so? Or you are already on eBay. But you are wondering if there are ways to get better prices, where 'better' of course depends on whether you are buying or selling. Well, here is an excellent how-to manual that still keeps some objective distance from its subject. That separation lets the author offer some disinterested advice. You can best see this when Karp evaluates the various listing options available to a seller. His suggestions, especially on one option, which he considers a total waste of money, are excellent.There are some omissions that would have made this a stronger book. He offers 100 tips. But...He discusses Phishing. Which has been used against eBay and Paypal users. But, as far as I can tell, he never uses this term. He REALLY should. We can imagine new users hearing about it, wanting to know more and not finding it in this book's index and hence passing on the book. And phishing is actually more dangerous than just one bad auction.Also, he omits three important tips. Firstly, once you have sold to a satisfied buyer, you should add that buyer to an email list. Next time you offer a similar item, very politely email her about it. (Of course, drop her if she opts out.) You can also add unsuccessful bidders in your auctions to this list, though you may have to go thru eBay's mailer to contact them. He mentions keeping a spreadsheet of your auctions, including the email addresses of your buyers. But he doesn't take the next simple step.Secondly, consider first offering future items directly to previous buyers, instead of listing on eBay. If no takers, then put on eBay. This does NOT violate any eBay rules because the buyer and seller now know each other and can talk about nonlisted items. There have been reports in the media about businesses selling on eBay partly to get just such a list of customers. Of course, there is now no eBay protection for buyer or seller. But if you are a business with a website and a good eBay rating, this reassures buyers. And you, as a seller, have a defacto credit check on buyers, by looking at their ratings.Thirdly, what would have been good is a tip on when it is NOT economic to list an item on eBay. Note that I did not say 'sell'. Amongst some power sellers, there has been increasing dissatisfaction. Prices are falling, eBay raises its fees and more auctions end without any bids. If you have an item for which there is little demand, then what is the chance that within 7 or 10 days of an auction, potential buyers will go to eBay and look for it? Remember, eBay always charges a listing fee. Of course, you can lower your price, to spur demand. But that costs you. At some point, things become uneconomic. In fact, if you have specialised books with a limited audience, Amazon is a viable alternative as it levies no listing fee, albeit with a higher commission if the book actually sells.Karp is a very experienced eBay user and a good programmer. But I really do not think the greatest readership for this book is people who want to or are able to program, and they will not be enamoured by the code examples. I suspect he could have expanded greatly on the points I raised, to the benefit of that readership."

This book makes a great matching gift to the CD. It is a fun read and nice to see that even though McGraw has reached a high level of success he has not forgotten the band that helped him to get there. There are quotes from his band and some candid shots of McGraw and his band. The new record is excellent and it is hard to believe that McGraw did not write his own songs when he is a master at their delivery and takes complete ownership. By far this is the best musical display of his talent and the book adds just another dimension to that music.

They have done the same with the Rings books.Harry is much more interesting, and less offensive, than the Tim LaHaye or Frank Peretti books or, quite frankly, any recent so-called ""Christian"" fiction.

With that being said, this is an enjoyable book with a predictable ending but an interesting path. The extensive scenes in Bath are intrinsically rewarding due to their humor and the knowledge that girlish precociousness has made it through to the 21st century pretty much intact. For the 99.99% of the world's population unfamiliar with 2nd and 3rd tier 18th century Gothic novels, the end notes to this edition are required to understand the parody.Plotline: girl goes to Bath, girl meets first 'friend' and then a true friend, girl visits big scary Abbey only to find out it is not actually the subject of her juvenile fantasy stemming from Gothic romances, girl falls in love, love is condemned, love conquers all. The narrative is very funny in parts, and always lively. One traditional criticism that holds true in my eyes is the uneven split between the first 3/4 (Bath) and the last 1/4 (the Abbey). Other than that, I have to say it is probably better than 75-80% of what modern writers can put out on their best day."

Jane Eyre was summer reading, and I figured he could knock out this assignment on our trip AND we could have some fun talking about it. This plan worked out wonderfully. The narration was great and we had some good discussions.One area that I made my son nuts was complaining about the character of Edward Rochester. I look at his behavior, and cannot understand why so many readers consider him a romantic hero.He treats women terribly. He ignores the emotional needs of Ad&egrave;le Varens. While it is noble that he pays for her care while his paternity is not clear, he has assumed the role of guardian and is not emotionally present for her.Next, Lady Ingram is a narcissistic gold digger. At the same time, she is a feeling human being (in the context of the story). Rochester just uses her to make Jane jealous. He gets Lady Ingram to dump him by telling her a lie when posing as a gypsy fortune teller. This is not an honorable way to end a relationship.He does his worst to Jane. He knows full well that he is already married. Yes, he really does not like Bertha Mason Rochester. No, he really REALLY does not like Bertha Rochester. But, he is legally married to Bertha and he knows it.We find that his plan is to wed her, take her on a honeymoon, ruin her for other men (by the standards of the time), and then drop the bombshell on her that he is already married and that their marriage is not legal.So why do so many women seem to overlook how badly Rochester was going to treat Jane and love this is a romantic story. Jane should have dumped him and not looked back. He is a cad and not worthy of true love. What am I missing?"

Gallagher,4/7,5.0,1071100800,Intriguing Speculation on Imminent Weather Catastrophe,"&quot;The Coming Global Superstorm&quot; rates five stars if for no other reason than it is a very thought-provoking book that will be sure to make the reader think about the implications of human induced climate change. Authors Art Bell and Whitley Strieber, better known as paranormal experts than climate change experts, have written a wildly speculative book that blends meteorolgical fact (the world is warmer than it used to be), with dire warning of imminent catastrophe (the northern hemisphere will experience a &quot;superstorm&quot; that will lead to a new ice age in our lifetime).The basic premise is that global warming adds so much energy to weather systems that eventually a superstorm will snow so much over the entire northern hemisphere, that it will actually &quot;tip&quot; the planet into an ice age that could last hundreds to thousands of years.The authors hypothesize that ice ages do not begin gradually, but instead the onset of an ice age occurs quite rapidly, within a week of previously warm climate conditions. One of their key pieces of evidence is that the remains of wooly mammoths have been found frozen with plants in their stomach that could only grow in warm climates, and yet the frozen remains of the mammoth were discovered in areas that became glaciated during the last ice age. Their implication is: one day the climate was warm, the next day it was an ice age.One of the other key points that seem to lend scientific credibility to their somewhat implausible scenario is a detailed description of how the warming of arctic waters will prevent the warmer north-flowing gulf stream waters from the tropics from mixing with the colder arctic waters. This results in a large mass of relatively cold water sitting off of northeastern U.S. and Canada, and it is this mass of cold water (no longer warmed by the gulf stream) that is the genesis of the &quot;superstorm&quot;.Implausible? Absolutely. Ridiculous? Of course. A fascinating book? Yes, without a doubt."

There is no attempt at balance here: the goal is to justify the conclusion of the title that Islam is an intolerant religion and life philosphy. Thus the essays presented here represent - persuasively - that singular view. Confirmation is readily available at site such as MEMRI, which provide translations of Islamic speeches and articles and often in the daily press which reminds us that something as commonplace in Western cultures as apostasy carries a death sentence under Islam.Owing to this singular viewpoint it is possible to argue that the collection is biased, that there is a different perspective not presented here and the reader should be willing to undertake their own research.Some of the essays, particularly those authored by non-governmental organizations pull their punches and may safely be ignored in whole or in part. The essays by Bat Ye'or in particular are frightening in their specificity. ""Jihad is therefore a genocidal war, according to the modern definiton of genocide. It encourages terrorism against civilians and does not diferentiate between innocent civilians and soldiers.""The case made here that Islam is intolerant and a threat is compelling. Indeed there may be an argument to be made against this position, but it is up to the reader to find it. Surely the death sentence imposed on Salman Rushdie alone should be enough to convince reasonable people of the dangers Islam represents to freedom of thought and expression.Jerry"

The fable-like feel of The Stones Cry Out results because Manase, the story's protagonist, never fully reenters the world after his experience near the end of World War II. His devotion to rock collecting keeps him emotionally tied to the cave in the Philippines where, as a soldier, he first learned about stones. Because this cave continually reappears in the book, The Stones Cry Out also reminded me of a painting, a tableau of rocks, caves, and death, where the characters are trapped in single setting, at a single point of time."

Having had guineas for 10 months before purchasing the book, I still learned several things which allowed me to successfully hatch and raise two different sets of guineas eggs. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone with an interest in hatching and/or raising guineas."

1932219234,The Merry Wives of Windsor (Arkangel Shakespeare),,,,2/5,5.0,881020800,I read this book and it brought me laughableness a lot.,"The Merry Wives of Windsor is loved by many people in the world because of the plentiful expressions, skillful characters' description and the natural laughable. It is not only a common comedy, but also a signpost from that we can see many things of the Elizabethan age when the author-William Shakespeare- lived. And this is one of the few works that he composed by himself, in other words, there are no any source to create it. The reason of coming into existence about this is unique and interesting. When Queen Elizabeth watched one of his historical plays (Henry the fourth), she was very pleased with John Falstaff in the play, then she ordered Shakespeare that he would make John be a hero and have him love in another play. It is said that the beginning of the story. There are lots of characters in the play as the other Shakespeare's works. The whole content is, Sir John Falstaff falls in love with Mistress Ford and Mistress Page, but the two mistresses make plan of ill-treating to him to refuse his love and to show their faithful and virtuous hearts to their husbands. Meanwhile, Fenton(a young gentleman), Slender(a country justice's kinsman) and Doctor Caius(a French physician) are all in love with Anne(daughter of Page and Mistress Page), and they think for wining her love respectively. At the end of the story, after Mr. and Mrs. Ford, Mr. and Mrs. Page and others make plans and ill-treat to Falstaff in the woods, all of them get reconciled with, while Anne Page get married with Fenton, and come to an end with joy. Besides them, some people who have strong personalities appear on the stage. For example, Mistress Quickly(Caius' servant) has a ready wit but a little stupid, or Sir Hugh Evans(a Welsh parson) who always speaks in rural accent but it makes us fanny and he plays an active part at the end of this play. We could see Shakespeare's genius in this play for there has many puns and unique accent which used by Hugh Evans. And it bring more cheerful mood to the play and laugh to the audience. Shakespeare described many men who is jealous of their wives or lovers in his works, and one of them is Mr. Ford who appears in this play. He has faith in his wife's affair and it brings some troubles. When this work was written, a woman generally could not get married to a man if he was not permitted by her father. However the times went by, many Pulitans came to insist that men and women could get married only when they loved each other. Fenton has also the pulitanical view for marriage. It was a new thought and I think Anne Page was attracted to his such way of thinking as well as his other good points. Also at that time in England, there was a tendency for every people to criticize about things which were against the social morals through passages of caricatures. For example, it was a fashion of the time for women to wear trousers but people criticized it, or they criticized for jealousy and affairs. In this play, John Falstaff is ill-treated by everyone and has a terrible experiences, and that's because he is immoral and unfair. Like these, this comedy has several points, and we can see the cultural features of the Shakespeare's period. Although I have ever read his works, I thought this one was very interesting and I came to like it the best. The character's personalities are made full use and I could see the author's abilities from that, too. The mistresses play active parts and they are very cheerful, livery and merry just as the title is. I think it made the audience(especially women) enjoy to watch, and the merriness of this play has been one of the most big reasons to attract people even nowadays."

1567181996,Hawaiian Religion & Magic,,A26TY6GCGBF5HT,Graves,1/2,2.0,1257811200,"So eager to show only the good, he wastes your time","In the world of new age books the late Scott Cunningham is a somewhat divisive person. Some consider him visionary opening up new vistas of understanding. Some consider him king of the fluffy bunny brigade who is so eager to see the good in people that he is unrealistic. Personally I think Cunningham has written some very good and very important books. Unfortunately he has also written some dreadful books and Hawaiian magic is one of those.Scott dedicated his last years to learning the spirit of the islands. That is their culture, their magic, their art and he desperately wanted to share this with the world. The problem was he was so bent on showing how good it was, to the exclusion of all that is `bad' that he rendered his final book into little more than a love fest, useless to the serious student, except to raise questions that it was his job to answer.Early on he says that the island cultures had war and slavery but dismisses this by saying in effect so did the west. But development in western culture often is based around these things. Why did they start and why did they end? How did the tradition start? These are a part of the fabric of society and to ignore them because they are ugly pretty well invalidates the study. Imagine trying to study the culture of the United States in the early 19th century without Dread Scott or the issue of Free or slave states?Perhaps even more damaging is Cunningham's unwillingness to explore the history of the islands even as he comments on it. By this I mean that if you read between the lines on his work you discover that there were two waves of immigration to the Islands from Asia. The second wave brought in far more rules and taboos and a level of oppression. Cunningham mentions these as he covers cultural taboos but then doesn't bother to ask ""why"" any other this happened. Why was there another wave? Why were they more formal than the first wave? And so forth.Cunningham contents himself to just say that they were that way without asking why. The effect is that the rituals and taboos he mention are cut from their context and become little more than cutesy little native gimmicks. Rather than reviving the Hawaiian culture he loved Cunningham relegated it back to where he found it, being as cultureal relevant and educational as a tourist in a flower pattern shirt wearing a plastic lay at a Honolulu beach barbecue.Cunningham has written some very good books, but here, he badly dropped the ball. No culture is all good or all bad. To truly understand a culture you have to understand and accept all its elements and how they interact to create the whole. All too often Western societies were so sure of their superiority that they tried to erase native culture and in so doing destroyed much that was good as well as what was bad. In showing Hawaiian culture as all good and ignoring what was bad or at least different, Cunningham shows the same degree of arrogance as the other white men whose work he claims to be trying to undo."

It is the definitework in that it portrays Nicholas not only as Tsar ofall the Russias , but as the father, the husband, andthe family man.All these aspects are crucial if we areto understand the man himself and the steps he tookto command his great empire. It is an extremely fairwork, showing the Tsar's shortcomings as a ruler, but yetat the same time his humaness, his vulnerability fromhis own position.Massie has excelled himself with this book, and I highlyrecommend it to any reader seeking an introduction tothis most fascinating period of Russian history.There have been criticisms of this book stating that Nicholasand his reign should have been studied in the context of say, other rulers of the time. This is a granted point, but one I feelMassie achieves in his commentary of the world spectrum on thewhole particularly in the years 1905 through to the first WorldWar.To isolate the &quot;family man&quot; from the ruler is impossible -they were part of each other.So congratulations to Robert Massie, this book is a verygreat achievement!"

Unlike most Baptist and Reformed authors he holds that a believer may not initially be baptized by the Holy Spirit on conversion. His view is similar in some ways to that of many charismatics. However, Jones emphasizes the sovereignty of the Holy Spirit and sees the signs of his baptism as a new power to bear witness to Christ accompanied by assurance and &quot;joy unspeakable&quot;. It is good reading and should make the reader rethink his view of the baptism of the Holy Spirit."

0613916417,Aristotle for Everybody: Difficult Thought Made Easy,,A1NRVXK3F8XIA2,Kenneth L. Miner,12/16,5.0,976147200,"Review of Adler, _Aristotle for Everybody_","Review of Adler, _Aristotle for Everybody_For Adler philosophy is informed by the concept of ""uncommon common sense"" (p xiv) which is ""the refinement of common sense by philosophical reflection"" (p 167). This notion grounds philosophy firmly in the everyday experience of the world.I will not summarize Adler's book; it is itself a summary of Aristotle's major thoughts (and in an Epilogue, references to Aristotle's works are given for each chapter). I will instead concentrate on some major issues which arise.Aristotle provides an explanation/description of the world by means of two fundamental pairs of concepts: matter and form, potentiality and actuality. Matter in itself is pure potentiality and does not exist in actuality (while God is pure actuality and has no potentiality). Forms are the aspects of things which allow us to perceive new instances; they become ideas in our minds. (Ideas, immaterial entities which result from the apprehension of the forms of things by the human mind, simply ARE the ""concepts"" which writers on meaning so often refer to. This is dealt with in detail in Adler's _Some Questions About Language_)Aristotle objected to the atomism of Leucippus and Democritus (atoms are the smallest units of matter, infinite in number, and indivisible) on two grounds: (a) that nothing can both be an ultimate unit of matter and be indivisible. Either it has a void, some empty space, inside it (in which case it is not an ultimate unit of matter) or it does not and the matter is continuous (in which case it is divisible, for whatever is continuous is infinitely divisible); (b) an infinite number of things cannot actually co-exist at any moment of time. This looks like inconsistency: he speaks of an infinite number of cuts, yet says an infinity is impossible. The difficulty is resolved by the distinction between the potential and the actual: for Aristotle there are two potential infinities, neither one of them actual: a potential infinite number of divisions, and a potential infinity of addition. Take addition: you cannot say there is a last integer, BUT you cannot actually carry out the infinite addition.Aristotle did believe in the infinity of time (in fact, in an eternal universe). But for him it did not exist all at the same moment. No two moments of time co-exist. Time can be infinite because its moments do not co-exist. When a given moment arrives, the last one no longer exists. Aristotle recognized two kinds of eternity: (a) timelessness (a state outside of time) (b) unending and unbeginning time. The universe was eternal in sense (b); God was eternal in sense (a).The distinction rests on his notion that time is a measure of motion or change. It follows that time has no beginning or end if motion/change has no beginning or end. But why did he believe that motion/change has no beginning or end? A hard question, deferred to the final chapter; but Adler does not in fact come back to it.The universe, being eternal, does not need a _First_ Mover, but it needs a (necessarily existing) _Prime_ Mover. While the question of why Aristotle believed that motion/change has no beginning or end remains unanswered, we can see fairly clearly why he believed no beginning or end was needed: _potential_ infinities are OK. After all, we need potential infinities for the lowly number series anyway.Material things have an immaterial aspect, namely, form. Form is not shape; it is idea.The mind is the form of forms. It must itself be immaterial in order to keep or hold forms separate from matter. Unlike sensing and perceiving, knowing does not involve any material organ, not even the brain. But the mind may be related to the brain.The Prime Mover did not create the universe (since the universe is eternal) but rather keeps all things in eternal motion/change. The question Aristotle did not raise is: since the universe does not exist necessarily, what keeps it in _existence_ (let alone motion/change)?I heartily recommend the book; and following upon it one might well read something on St. Thomas Aquinas, who dealt with some of the matters which were problematic for Aristotle.Ken Miner"

B00086037Q,A hero of our time,,A2Y91AI8L4CBIN,Radcliffe Camera,10/11,4.0,966643200,Move Over Onegin: Enter Pechorin,"A Hero of Our Time introduces a most memorable character, Pechorin, who, had the novella been named after him, would stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Eugen Onegin in fame. He derives from the same tradition as Onegin, that of the 'superfluous' man, though he moves beyond his predecessor (and prefigures others) in the degree to which he reeks havoc on a personal level. The novella consists of stories only nominally connected, and it is fair to say that the second half is better than the first. The centrepiece is the diary of Pechorin which contains a full narrative of his 'adventures' at a small holiday town. It just has to be read to be believed: it is 'lady-killing' and 'white-anting' at its clinically destructive best. Readers of Eugen Onegin will notice similarities, though the prose form allows much deeper characterisation, for which one is certainly not sorry. Lovers of later 19th-century Russian literature will appreciate this book in its prefiguring of characters and of settings in, among others, Turgenev, Dostoyevsky, and Chekhov. Lermontov died young and in a very Romantic fashion (a duel); one can only be sorry that he did not live to write more."

I felt the book was extremely slanted and left little to be desired in terms of suspense or plot twist. What's more - there HAS to be a way for Ann Rule to drive her point home without repeating key plot elements verbatim over and over again. Often times, I would put the book down, only to find when I picked it up again, I felt I had accidentally lost my place and gone backwards. Seriously, paragraphs and paragraphs of unnecessary repitition litter this otherwise gripping story of a mother driven to horrific revenge to ""punish"" her husband for his actions. Yes, this is true crime and consistent details among third parties are key - but hearing the same phrases about the father, Mike, again and again certainly supported the fact that Deborah had turned the kids against him - but really, they were mentioned no less than four times throughout (often by the same people, in different conversations) - just to make sure we ""got it."" Paraphrasing the trial portion also would have been nice. I could have (and did) skip ahead just to get to the climax - after all the story is written in such an anti-Deborah fashion that my mind was made up after the first chapter. After that, there's Mike's letter and an Epilogue which adds no insight or clues that weren't already brought to bear earlier in the book.Overall the story drags at times and could've been more concisely written. But Ann Rule is the master - so I'm not sure who could've told it better... I was hooked on her style after reading The Stranger Beside Me many years ago. This won't be the last book of hers I read."

One hilarious story King has put together with spectacular characters where idiot savants are only exceeded by the devil. Where are the fairies in this fairy tale? Where Santa? Where Freddy Kruger?Ah...King loves to dole out those Freddy Kruger kind of stories; the slashing, the flying blood. Mix in a telepathic little old Matrix style black woman and you've got a Dancing with the Stars partner for the Evil One (who only needs a little sympathy). Good grief, King even brings Jimmy Morrison back as an archetype of evil for the west coast; I don't think he likes those dirty hippies one bit (one of the non-fairies working for the negro woman is a really nice fellow, a rock singer with issues). He cleverly brings in a parody of GWB the younger, aka West Texas. This is a well made story...very well made about some funny childhood fantasies that just won't stop being one away hits. Plus his hilarious use of modern day allusions to rock bands as authors of old would cite the classics to demonstrate their education. Overall, the word hackneyed does come to mind but credit goes to King for throwing a more modern spin on it.2. Serious: King can really put a story together. You gotta respect that, but, I find this story bothersome.It's the darkness of it overall which I don't approve of and his pandering to our prurience. All the overt violence, seemingly random and rife amongst us; all the darkly weird sexuality with his masturbation fantasies; the grotesque unnatural sexual unions (even his ""normal"" sexual unions are strained and almost unnatural, not surprisingly); the dark and menacing psychological depths of his evil characters are too well articulated by the characters, especially the retards elevated to savants, even when they are on the ""good"" side(Tommy magically starts to overcome his retardedness...GIVE US A BREAK).The book comes close to having the no redeeming social value of pornography pretty much pure and simple. The finely crafted wrapper of religion and love, retardation and genius, god and the devil deserves some credit, but only in the detail.It's KIng's vision of the present and the future (or his own personal nightmare more likely). Sad and sorry it is what he sees and so grossly simplifies: right and wrong, heaven and hell, god and the devil. Is he simply pandering to us? It really feels like that. He just body slams us repeatedly with the devil or his agents and then wraps the wound with the mystic gauze of Christian shamanism. Plus his penchant for Rousseau's country living vision (Maine, anyone? You want Nature? Go to the Amazon, ya' wanker) compliments his distaste for science and modernism (his understanding of science is lacking it's obvious no matter how he tries to make up for it in his descriptions; he doesn't really understand physical plants or materials and blames science for societies' evils because of it).For a guy so smart, it seems like such a sorry and empty vision. Maybe he just wants to sell books and puff himself; hard to find fault with that, eh?He's really good...as a writer or a story teller.If the same Supreme Court Justice who lifted the ban on Joyce's Ulysses read this book he would sustain it as pandering pornography. STOP: it is so wrong to hold The Stand next to Ulysses. Retract that statement. Naked Lunch will do; The Stand is more like that: a disturbed mind's projection into good prose.King needs to write this stuff for himself; to vent (at least Burroughs admitted to this). His statement about the book...something about the great pleasure he got out of destroying 99.6% of mankind is pretty close to admitting it. The guy really unabashedly just pushes all those ""console me"" buttons we have about believing there really is ""something out there"" looking over us, watching us, lovingly, we like to think; until King reminds us it's Beelzabub ready to chew us a new arsehole; even with all the soft telepathic connections he has uniting the various factions together, inter and intra, is just more dreamy button pushing by Mr. King; we all like to think the connections are there as long as it's with friendlies. Well, as King rightly points out: If THOSE exist, so does the DEVIL; what he neglects to point out is it's all simply us. We have met the enemy and he is us. (Pogo)Spank you, Mr. Stephan King...spank you berry much. Now...go rot in hell and keep it to yourself.Rank: 2.5 - 3.5 ; it's so well written; it's a coherent (w)hole, a puerile fantasy pandering pestilence with little redeeming value."
156511566X,Interpreter of Maladies (Highbridge Distribution),,A2YWNYGN68Q3NX,"Kawaiineko ""kawaiineko""",0/0,3.0,978566400,"If someone said you were exotic, would you believe them?","The stories reveal to the readers &quot;truths&quot; about lives lived in desparation or of free will, or lives lived in situations that involve immigration, poverty, illness, or other situations billions of people find themselves in living life on Earth. This book of stories involves ordinary people then, living ordinary lives of decency or indecency, of humor, of humility and of quiet desperation, who just happen to be of Indian descent. Ms. Lahiri uses details of foods, of cooking, of color and of nature in beautiful ways and often as metaphors to exclaim and reveal to the readers, the certain &quot;truths&quot; or &quot;conditions&quot; of her characters. The stories in themselves are interesting enough, if not exactly Earth shattering as all the critics are raving. After all, this book did win the Pulitzer Prize. Fine then, why did I agonize first over buying this book, after reading one story, &quot;A Temporary Matter,&quot; over the Internet? I also agonize over what I think about the book.As an aspiring writer, who came back to her calling after 10 years of trying to ignore the promptings with in me--as Herman Hesse said in &quot;Demian,&quot; why was it so difficult to live in accordance with the promptings from within?--When I first found out that Ms. Lahiri, who is the same age as I am, had won the Pulitzer, my first reaction was incredulity then pure GREEN ENVY! I too was an English major, thought about getting my PhD in literature, but thought better (or worse) and got a terminal graduate degree (ha ha) and entered the professional world (ha ha). Well, yadda, yadda, yadda, I did not want to pay the price of struggling through student debts and living my 20s in the library. Oh well, these are the rewards sometimes--the Pulitzer--well good for her. Fine then.But, I agonized over giving this book 3 stars and not 4, and I agonized over why I was sorely disappointed when I read a book by someone who was my age, also Asian and a fellow writer who had made good. In all fairness, I will preface by saying that I had the same &quot;reaction&quot; but more strongly to Amy Tan's book &quot;Joy Luck Club,&quot; which I enjoyed watching as a movie but DID not like from page one. This is why. As an Asian American, and as a woman, like Ms. Lahiri (and like Ms. Tan), I am ecstatic that we have a literary voice. However, I can not stomach the &quot;exotification&quot; of the Asian experience! It's as simple as that. Another reviewer on Amazon said that she found this book to be a bit too exotic for the average American reader, she thought. Well, let me tell you, who wouldn't find this book ringing a bit exotic. If you lived in India or if you were Indian American, would you consider yourself exotic?? Of course not! So why should this book or any book on anyone who is not of European decent be exotic?? Ms. Lahiri could have made the same observations, same insights and commentaries about the lives of her characters without employing the traditional American practice of &quot;exotification&quot; of experiences that are considered outside of the &quot;NORM,&quot; whatever that is.I have to say in fairness again, that some Southern American writers also exploit, oops, explore the &quot;exotification&quot; of their people. Look at John Berendt with the based on truth &quot;Midnight In the Garden of Good and Evil.&quot; There are many other writers, particularly Southern, as it were, who write short and longer stories about &quot;weird&quot; and &quot;exotic&quot; people and settings. Of course, as someone once said, who wants to read about boring people? True, but does the stories, as in &quot;Interpreter of Maladies,&quot; have to be so formulaic? Do we have to ah and goo goo ga ga over painfully ordinary activities as cooking, written however adroitly, to capture dramatic tension? Do we always have to marvel at the beauty regimens of slathering on coconut oil in our black hairs? Do we always have to marvel how different we are because we don't drive on the right side of the road like Americans? (Ms. Lahiri mentions that in India people drive on the left side of the road, she mentions this no less than in three of the nine stories, most likely to puctuate how different things are from there to here). Do we have to pander to critics and crank out contrived eloquence and cloying exoticism? Lest anyone thinks that this is a personal review, let me tell you, it is. I have high expectations of writers and of critics!"

Watts ""lover of intelligent fiction""",1/2,4.0,986860800,It's About Time....Yah for Black Erotica!!!,"Okay, Addicted gets four stars from me only because I feel the beginning of the story line was unnecessary. Basically, one-fourth of the book was devoted to talking about Zoe's childhood and how she and her current husband met, starting back at elementary school/junior high school years all the way up through high school. For me, it was just a little too detailed. A single chapter could've been devoted to this. I understand that the author wanted us to have a clear idea of Zoe's dedication to her husband, what they've been through together and the development of their relationship. However, it was a bit too much. I found myself silently saying &quot;Hurry Up Already&quot;. Yah, I was a bit restless since I knew it was a novel spiced up with sensuality and eroticism. So, be forewarned. For those of you ready to get to the nitty gritty, it may be a short wait. BUT, when the story finally gets moving, it heats up! Zoe is a trip. You find yourself emphathizing with the fact that she tries constantly to communicate to her husband that she isn't satisfied sexually only to have him turn his back on those feelings. Ugh!!! She does try, but soon her need to &quot;feel&quot; gets the best of her and she tip toes out. You feel her pain because, outside of sex, her marriage is great and one we all wish we had or will have. But, the marriage is not enough to satisfy that itch that won't go away. And that's what Zoe is battling. The girl takes on three lovers. Yes, three!! While finally being satisfied sexually and beyond her wildest dreams, she's in turmoil and her lies start to unravel, not to mention her great life. Basically, the story takes you on this journey with Zoe. There are quite a few ups and downs and plenty of surprises with every turn of the page. If you're interested in something different, check this book out. It's definetly a pleasure to read, especially because its from a sistah's perspective (refreshing!)."

Valkin ""Arran Valkin""",12/12,4.0,1185062400,"Outstanding, musical, and playable method","There realy are not many great methods for the blues out there, but Tim Richards is thorough and goes into the required detail to show you how each blues style works.The examples are very playable, suiting more or less an intermediate level pianist. Richards is one of the few take-away instruction teachers to be concerned about fingerings, and takes the trouble to suggest good ones. His playing instructions work very well and add a dimension that you don't often get in these method books - he has a great insight into the chords, and the notes and the way they fit the music. The breakdown of theory is very well explained, if sometimes overdone. But he never floods you with scales without showing you how to apply them - that in itself is a good thing!Richards' choice of music is impeccable, and calssic blues standards of af all styles are presented from boogie, to funk, slow blues, and some jazzy numbers. And he shows you music in a number of keys so you aren't stuck to one or two and get a work out in the other keys. I found the music very playable, and well sounding, although I didn't always find the improvising instructions that intuitive.The historical background he gives is accurate and informative and the pictures of blues and jazz legends really make this book interesting.My criticism of the book is that it should have stretched up to the more advanced techniques of the blues - where the top players are, like Oscar Peterson, for example. That is its dissapointment - a teacher as good as this who dedicated the time to work a out a progressive and different course in blues shouldn't have stopped at the middle level. He surely should have stretched us, his interested audience up to the highest level.But this should not stop you from using this very useful and inspiring book - I Thank you sincerely Tim."

The author describes in detail the creatures that once lived in Europe, from the small and archaic, e.g. multituberculates, to the large and more modern, e.g. mammoths. Some mention is also made of non-mammals such as the killer birds and crocodiles. The book is lavishly illustrated with several full color plates in the center and numerous black-and-white sketches throughout the text. Mauricio Anton's pictures alone make the book worth owning for any prehistoric mammal enthusiast. The downside to this work, and why I only rate the book 4 stars, is that it's rather tough to read for someone who's not well-versed in the jargon of biology and paleontology. A glossary would have been really helpful. A hefty bibliography is supplied for those who wish to immerse themselves in the scholarly literature. I must admit that I had to start over a couple of times to grasp the material. This book isn't quite the readable account of mammalian evolution I was hoping for, having just recently been inspired to learn more about the subject by ""Walking with Prehistoric Beasts"".

The Awakening is by far one of the best books I have ever read and I have read hundreds of novels. I truly believe that most every woman can see part of herself in Edna Pontellier. Out of the thousands of significant women characters that have been depicted in novels, Edna is certainly one of the most complex as well as realistic. Her emotions were raw, REAL, and completely unabashed and honest. Chopin included so many &quot;tabboo&quot; topics, including lesbianism. I can read this book over and over and still never get tored of reading it. I will always see Edna as a woman who wanted to come to grips with her own sexuality and independence. Although I did see her as selfish, I ultimately realized that she felt trapped in a society that stressed women as being the nurturers and taking care of their husbands and children...they could not dream or fufill the dreams that they had. Edna desperately wanted to cross this boundary that was set upon her society during that time. The ending was so emotional to me personally that I never fail to cry every time I read it. This book is incredibly emotional and original. Chopin realized that women should not have limits. It is just sad that society during Chopin's time did not think that women should have any other choices."

She's my favorite author and has been for a long time. I first read this book about 7 years ago and of course fell in love with it. I re-read it for a book club next week. I very rarely read books a second time. I think this is only my 3rd time.It is a beautifully-written book, like all her others. In Persuasion, Anne Elliot is persuaded by a family friend to not pursue a relationship with Captain Wentworth because of his inferior place in society. Many years later, she is reacquainted with him and her love for him has not diminished. She is unsure of how he feels about her. He is now a prestigious and admired captain; his station in life completely changed from before.They find each other in the same social circles, but his pride and her uncertainty of his feelings prevents them from reuniting. At some point, it is believed that each of them is attached to another.The novel has its funny assortment of characters just like all of Austen's works. And, Austen saves the wonderful union of Anne and Captain Wentworth for the last pages, as in her other books. But, that makes it sweet as you finally read the happy ending. I actually cried as I read the touching letter he writes to Anne at the end."

Towards the middle is when the story really gets going. I was pleasantly surprised that it also included a story about two friends opening up a business...I never saw it coming but enjoyed that. I actually just started a busines myself and love to read both fiction and non-fiction stories on the same topic.This story is about friends and the trials they go through. Cath the main character, finally gets her guy in the end. I never saw Si's ordeal coming. Because Green chose to write about this, it actually lifted the book into another light for me because of it. She dealt with a hard and deep topic but incorporated it just right within the story. I was really hoping that Portia would NOT ruin the marraige of Lucy and Josh...but didn't expect that turn either! This is a good thing!There were many twists and turns once the story got going. So if you're thinking about reading it, do it but just hang in there and you'll end up loving it.I am definitely going to give Green another try and read another one of her books."

B000L2L8VM,Kon-tiki,,,,10/11,5.0,928800000,An eye opener to a lost age of adventure,"This is an immensely inspiring account of human adventure and perseverance. It sets man against sea, thin odds against practical ingenuity, conventional academic thought against the independent thinker. This four thousand mile journey across barren, treacherous seas can't help but inspire the would-be adventurer. The adventurers' single mindedness and determination, in the face of naysaying world experts (who said they would never succeed, and that their boat would sink at mid-sea), shows how determination and perseverance can lead to accomplishing what some may view as impossible goals, and in so doing it pushes the boundaries and commonplace notions of what is possible. We see that not all adventurous fools and are so foolish; that determination can see one across a massive barren and stormy ocean, real or metaphorical. On completing the book, all that remains is for the reader to respond to its call for adventure and begin plans for achieving personal goals or adventures ... all the tools needed for accomplishment are demonstrated in this voyage. In a corporate world where too often money is the primary force in leading us to act, where the value of an activity is measured by its potential financial payback, it is refreshing to be reminded of other motivations for action, and of other rewards. Can this book reawaken a spirit of adventure which may seem irrelevant to modern social or commercial life? Can it remind us how to dream and the virtues of following our dreams? I am reminded in these pages how, why, and where I can find adventure ... one walks away from the book convinced that anything is possible, should I choose to look beyond conventional thought or lifestyle and reach for the stars."

I've read Pride and Prejudice &amp;Emma and loved them both. However, I was disappointed with Sense and Sensibility. The story of two sisters altogether different from each other could be an interesting plot ... if it had Austen's usual style. Austen is famous for her keeping her balance between too romantic and too realistic. This time her style is much too romantic and by no means both feet on the ground.

The philosophy is to provide lots of love, understanding, forgiveness, slack and carefully chosen incentives and guidance while encouraging friendships among youngsters who will balance one another out if they spend time together. You'll recognize lots of Marmee's loving approach in Jo's more rough and tumble perspective. It's a nice combination.For those who loved the child-centered world of Little Women, you'll be entranced by what Jo does to educate and raise her own boys, her nephew and niece, a troublesome neighbor girl, male boarders and some unfortunate orphans.Much of the novel focuses on the character development of two poor orphans, Nat and Dan, who find Jo's Plumfield (which she inherited near the end of Little Women) to be an unfamiliar paradise of a home and school that requires some adjusting to.Although the title is Little Men, there's plenty of focus on Daisy, twin sister to Demi, Nan, an independent girl with lots of energy, and Bess, Amy and Laurie's daughter. There are pretend balls, teas, and dramatic performances that echo those in Little Women.But the male slant that is subdued in Little Women bursts forth in Little Men as the book recounts pranks, brawls, collections of disgusting items, pillow fights, taming a colt and doing heavy chores.Like Little Women, the chapters are really short stories involving the same characters as they progress from month to month.If you haven't read Little Women, by all means start there. An important part of the fun of Little Men is finding out what happened next to Meg, Jo, Amy and Laurie."
B000OVTKTC,Interview With The Vampire,,A2SC3E79M93TL4,ATICE,1/1,5.0,1343520000,The True Vampire Series,"I grew up with Anne Rice's works at a young age, because of my cousin. We would watch the movie adaptation of this incredible book, and I would find myself liking it more and more as I watched it.I remember renting this book from my local public library when I was in high school, and I read it day and night. I took it to school, and even skipped a day of school just to read the last bit of it.I purchased this book again, just this year, right before a convention called C2E2 came along. I wanted to purchase the book for a long time, but when I finally read on C2E2's website that Anne Rice was going to be a guest at the convention... You could not imagine my joy. She seemed very happy to see all of her fans and even hosted a panel with another gentleman. I honestly could not stay for long, because I was too excited that I found myself running down stairs. This was of course to start standing in line to make the autograph session. To no surprise, I found myself at the end of quite a long line. I did not care. I could not wait to meet the author. When I finally did, I was completely starstruck. We had only exchanged a few words like ""Hi. How are you?"" ""Good, and you?"" and I found myself on my way to hang out with some of my friends again.As I've said, I basically grew up with this series of books... More importantly, I grew up with 'Interview with the Vampire' and 'The Vampire Lestat (Vampire Chronicles)'.I love Anne Rice's writing style. Every time I read the books in this series, I cannot put them down without picking them back up, not even for a moment. I like that the writer does this.

B000JV8N8Q,Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition),,A1EKTLUL24HDG8,Bill R. Moore,0/0,5.0,1265760000,Sublime Masterpiece,"Though not Russian fiction's father in Nikolai Gogol's sense of adapting the language and producing its first notable fictional works, Ivan Turgenev is the direct antecedent of the psychological characterization and philosophical dramatization that is most closely associated with it and thus arguably its true father. Fathers and Sons, his most famous work and masterpiece, was the first Russian novel to attract Western praise, particularly winning over Henry James, who hailed it as a masterwork and championed Turgenev over the Russian writers who soon overshadowed him. One can debate Turgenev's merits relative to giants like Fyodor Dostoevsky and Leo Tolstoy, but he certainly provides an interesting contrast, and Fathers and Sons has long had an indisputable place alongside their great works in the world canon.The book is of course most famous for Evgeny Vasilevich Bazarov, its protagonist, who is both painstakingly realistic and thoroughly symbolic. He typifies the young, European-influenced, middle-class liberal that Turgenev rightly thought was a rising Russian power. A self-proclaimed nihilist, he rejects religion, conventional morality, and nearly every other traditional Russian virtue. He claims to believe in nothing but has a great passion for science and seems to believe in a sort of self-reliance. Though influenced by archetypes like Alexander Pushkin's Eugene Onegin, he was an essentially original creation - Turgenev's most memorable and famous character. Anyone at all familiar with Russian literature can immediately see that he became a prototype, his most famous manifestation being Raskolnikov in Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment a few years later. However, he is interesting enough in his own right, and his ambivalent depiction is fascinating. Though he is ostensibly a cautionary figure, a negative example, Turgenev was open-minded enough not to condemn him outright. His dark end is indeed a warning that pure nihilism is a dead end, but Turgenev at times seems as enthralled by Bazarov as anyone. This ambiguity was the main reason that the novel got very mixed reviews; it satisfied neither those who sympathized with Bazarov nor those who condemned him. Turgenev was stung and wrote less prolifically and enthusiastically from then on, but time has shown that the uncertain portrayal is exactly the book's greatest strength. Bazarov represents a path that Russia could have taken - or, if you will, one pole of human nature -, though admittedly an extreme one, and cannot be lauded or condemned outright. Turgenev was brave enough to give an honest portrayal, and the profoundly believable and insightful psychological portrait retains its power. Bazarov is one of the most interesting characters in a century full of great ones. He is hard to fully love or hate; he certainly has many despicable qualities, but only Pollyannas can deny some of his points, and the force with which he argues, in combination with his cynical apathy, has a certain perverse charm. We can debate him and what he stands for ad nauseum, but it is unlikely that anyone who reads the book will soon forget him.There is of course far more to the novel, not least its vivid dramatization of the title's implied generation gap. Turgenev saw an ever-widening chasm between the liberals of his generation and the Bazarovs, dramatizing it with striking verisimilitude and stunning philosophical and psychological depth. His generation is represented by the brothers Nikolai and Pavel Petrovich Kirsanov. They have also embraced Europeanization but in ways that Bazarov finds contemptibly superficial: speaking French, wearing foreign clothes, etc. More fundamental is their continued clinging to traditional morality and institutions. Their interactions with Bazarov make clear that, religion and morality aside, the generation gap was to a great extent a class issue. The Kirsanovs are aristocrats, and Pavel Petrovich in particular resents the upstart Bazarov. Their clash soon culminates in a highly symbolic duel suggesting, especially in its aftermath, that while the Bazarovs may initially gain the upper hand, there is much to be said for the older generation, which should not be written off so quickly. Nikolai Petrovich is more moderate, abandoning tradition to the extent of taking a lower-class woman as a mistress and even having a child with her, yet aware enough to constantly worry about offending his brother. He can sympathize with Bazarov and is even willing to listen to his ideas but above all simply wants harmony. His son Arkady is at yet another place on the spectrum, respecting the elders but so nave and joyous in his youthfulness that he becomes a Bazarov disciple almost without knowing.These conflicts play out in various ways but primarily through Arkady, the only character who really changes. It can be assumed that he was squarely in familial tradition before college, where he nearly became a Bazarov clone, and he finally takes solace in love's redemptive power. There is no doubt that Turgenev thinks this last the right path - that we are supposed to think, as Arkady finally does, that Bazarovism leads only to wasteful self-destructiveness, making true happiness impossible and keeping us from doing the world any good. Some will of course disagree, but Arkady's progression is very plausibly written; it is hard not to sympathize and be glad for his eventual peace and bliss. The novel is thus among other things an excellent bildungsroman.Perhaps the most remarkable thing about the book is how Turgenev dramatizes all this - and even makes his point clear - without heavy-handedness. Novels tackling such weighty issues often let didacticism overwhelm story, but Fathers and Sons is never guilty of this nearly always fatal sin. He is also a master stylist; his often lyrical prose encompasses not only dense philosophical speculation but also much sublime beauty. The last paragraph in particular is unforgettable in its precise beauty and profoundly moving sentiment - so well-written that even those who cynically disagree with the conclusion, and thus the book's overall message, cannot deny its immense power. Most notable of all is that Turgenev manages to do all this in under 250 pages. This is the greatest difference between him and the more famous Russian masters known for their thick tomes. Turgenev eschews their great attention to detail, lengthy dialogue, and long philosophical asides. Those who, like James, detested such ""loose, baggy monsters"" may join him in preferring Turgenev, and the differences are substantial enough that even those who dislike Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and their ilk should not pass over Turgenev automatically on account of it. That said, he shares enough of their great elements - indeed, inspired many of them - that their fans should check him out. His remarkable conciseness is certainly less intimidating, and there are many benefits to reading the Russian greats chronologically. In short, the appeal of Fathers and Sons is so great and diverse that the book is a must for practically anyone who appreciates great literature."
1569711402,Domu: A Child's Dream,,A3R6XTCAE182S,"Mary J. Alderdice ""geek, book lover, craft fiend""",1/1,5.0,1025913600,It's always the quiet ones...,"Wow. Just... wow. Once you pick up Domu, you'll find that you blaze through it very quickly, but that at the same time, each scene will leave a marked impression on you.Domu takes place in modern-day Tokyo, and is centered around a monolithic housing complex which has had more than its fair share of mysterious deaths. Suicides, accidental deaths, murders, and deaths which have not even been able to be classified... an inordinate number of people seem to meet untimely ends at the Tsutsumi Public Housing Complex. The police are stymied, as well they should be when faced with exceedingly violent suicides and building jumpers who somehow manage to get onto the roof through a locked door. And the residents are increasingly uneasy.What nobody knows is that senile little Cho Uchida, abandoned by his family, living alone, with the mind of a child, is the force behind these mysterious deaths. Possessing great extrasensory powers, Uchida sees the tenants of the Tsutsumi Public Housing Complex as his toys, to torment, or to kill, as his childish whim dictates. That is, until a little girl by the name of Etsuko moves into the complex. Armed with powers of her own, Etsuko is appalled by the things she sees (and senses) Uchida doing, and declares war.Soon the entire complex is trapped in the midst of the battle between these two mental giants, and between the death of innocents and the destruction wreaked in offensive and defensive measures by the two combatants... the housing complex, and some of the people investigating the mystery deaths, will never be the same again.Though Katsuhiro Otomo is probably best known for his work on Akira, Domu should definitely stand out as a meaningful, powerful work in its own right. Gorgeous artwork and a story made all the more chilling by the childlike temperaments of the main characters make Domu a story well worth reading."

The first one, Farewell to Arms, I read in high school, and never finished. The second, Old Man and the Sea, I read in college after visiting Cuba, and loved it.The Sun Also Rises falls somewhere in the middle between the two. I love Hemingway's style of writing, and the personal tone...you really feel like you are getting a glimpse into Hemingway's psyche. I have grown to like his concise writing style, it makes me work harder as a reader, and I appreciate that. I love that he gives very little description in regards to what any of the characters look like (except for Lady Brett Ashley's short hair), so an image is formed in my mind based entirely on their actions.Like some of his other books, It is easy to tell what Hemingway's true passions are...I found the sections on fishing in the Pyrenees, the running of the bulls and bullfighting in Pamplona to be the most descriptive and interesting part of the novel."

Moiraine and Siuan seemed so strong and confident, and this story seems to make them even more personable. It DOES seem a bit odd to come back to them at this point in time in the story seeing as how both of them have become much less important in the main plot by book 10 (don't want to spoil it for people who don't know). The one thing that truly excited me about this book is the number of doors that are being opened. I see other series about Artur Hawkwing's times and other &quot;historical&quot; series.

B000CC49LC,The Wife : A Novel,,A3D9G8256YTWC7,Ben Mattlin,2/3,4.0,1068163200,"Skilled writing, small idea","I was drawn to this book after reading an excerpt in a review. What brilliant writing! What clear, penetrating prose and seamless storytelling! And indeed, now that I've finished the entire book, I still think the writing style-the sheer craft of it-is mesmerizing, intelligent, funny and clean as fine crystal. What lies beneath the polished prose, however-the plot elements and story structure itself-are sadly rather ordinary and poorly developed.In fairness, I was gripped through much of the book and am envious of its accomplishments. It is not for every taste, though. My first disappointment came quickly. No sooner had I read past the original excerpt when I realized I'd been sorely misdirected. The divorce-or at least separation-we've anticipated since the first or second sentence is ... how shall I say this? ... delayed. Most of the story is a flashback. All right, that's fair enough. Yet I again had to adjust my perspective when it turned out ""The Wife"" is mostly about THE HUSBAND. We get very little of the wife's background, childhood etc.Ah, but isn't that the point? This wife is selfless-slavishly devoted to her husband's career and reputation. Nonetheless, deeper into the story other narrative problems were utterly puzzling. Wouldn't the virgin college girl of the 1950s be the least bit self-conscious about her adequacy-clothes, body-before her first sexual experience? Later, shouldn't more have been made of the one and only encounter between the wife of the title and her mother? That scene ends too quickly and anticlimactically for me. And toward the end, when one of the main characters seems to exacerbate another's dangerous medical condition, a mere half-sentence about feelings of guilt and responsibility is conspicuous by its absence.Perhaps this is a woman's book and I'm just a pigheaded man. But my own wife disliked the book vehemently. She said she guessed the end early on. I defend ""The Wife,"" but I think now it is best appreciated by those involved in the business of writing. (Guilty.) Like Balzac, Wolitzer is here a writers' writer. I didn't always understand or agree with her fictional examples of ""bad writing"" versus ""good writing."" (And she comes across as very judgmental.) Yet if you have any interest in the distinction between bad writers with great ideas and gifted writers with small, inadequate ideas-and I do-then this book is for you.Ultimately, Wolitzer would fall into the ""skilled practitioner, ho-hum concept"" category, though who knows? That may be a guise, an intentional characteristic of the earnest, short-sighted character she's created."

Beck MD, is the father of cognitive therapy and professor of Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania. His books on depression and anxiety broke new ground in the field of psychotherapy by demonstrating the power of breaking the link between automatic thoughts and emotional reactions. He married Judge Phyllis Beck in 1950 and the couple is blessed with children and grandchildren.I have often been frustrated by the destructive habit patterns that emerge in my relationships. LOVE IS NEVER ENOUGH has helped me to understand their origin and more importantly, how to remove them. It has been a valuable tool not only for my personal but also my spiritual relationships.Dr Beck writes that, _The essence of marital cognitive therapy consists of exploring with troubled partners their unrealistic expectations, self-defeating attitudes, unjustified negative explanations, and illogical conclusions. Through a tune-up of their ways of drawing conclusions about each other and talking to each other, partners have been helped by cognitive therapy to relate to each other in a more reasonable, less hostile way.&quot;And it works! The basic principle of Dr Beck's approach is simple yet substantial. The cornerstone is to strive for a solid foundation of trust, loyalty, respect and security. In short, to become a committed ally, a supporter and champion of my mate. Second, cultivate the tender, loving part of the relationship, and finally, strengthen the partnership by developing a sense of cooperation, consideration and compromise.These are lofty goals with abstract meanings. I have always known that I wanted these admirable attributes as a part of my relationships, however, it was not until I studied Dr Beck's cognitive therapy that I gained the tools required to implement. By recognizing when distortions automatically enter my thoughts, I am able to resist the naturally tendency of accepting them. Opposing the temptation to react provides me with control over my emotions and prevents me from falling into destructive behaviours and habit patterns. I am able to respond in ways that are consistent with my hopes, dreams and goals for my relationship.If you are interested in developing stronger more secure relationships in all parts of your life, this book may be interesting to you.PEACE"

B0006EOB6Y,Wise blood,,A1REA4SQZVGHI4,Michelle,18/20,5.0,957571200,The Undermining Themes of Wise Blood,"Flannery O'Connor's Wise Blood contains many reoccuring and undermining religious themes. Her main theme includes the redemption of man by Christ. She also depicts the grotesques in society through her use of her subject matter. O'Connor bluntly uses this religious theme to prove that redemption is difficult for her characters because of the distorted sense of moral purpose in her characters. Throughout her novel, a major emphasis is placed on materialsim and money. Through her use of imagery, symbols, and details, O'Connor produces the unbalanced prosperity of the society, which leaves little assurance to blissfulness in life.Her protagonist, Hazel Motes, becomes a fated preacher or even prophet; however, Hazel rejects any form of Christ in his life including the image of himself. Even though it is rejected, his fate dominates him throughout the novel, and via his rejection of Christ, Hazel preaches the Church without Christ. Hazel finds that his reason for existence is to form the Church without Christ. Eventually, Hazel sacrifices everything in his life so as to not accept Christ which eventually destroys him. It would have been much better to sacrifice everything he had to begin with in order to accept Christ and let Christ take over from there. This would have prevented Hazel's destruction rooted from his rejection of Christ. This proves O'Connor's purpose of showing a society full of people who cannot accept Christ and who are, at most times, destroyed in some way in their attempt to reject their religious side.O'Connor mocks evangelism and the all too popular &quot;preachers for profits,&quot; who have no training in religion what so ever, in order to display her scorn for popularized anti-cerebral religion. Hazel, whose name is actually Hebrew for &quot;he who sees God,&quot; ironically but purposefully covers himself with a figurative veil. This veil covers his soul and his senses from seeing Christ as He should be seen. His nickname, Haze, also proves his inability to see clearly.Throughout this novel, Hazel runs into several people who perform mysterious acts of goodness for him trying to help Hazel find Grace. This is also ironic condiering that most of Hazel's acquaintances are profiteer preachers. Some of these acquaintances include: Asa Hawks, an ex-evangelist, who pretends to blind himself for sympathy and profit as he &quot;hawks&quot; for money around the city; Enoch Emery, the boy with &quot;wise blood,&quot; who cannot find his inner self and becomes Hazel's follower in the Church without Christ; and Hoover Shoats, another profiteer preacher, who pretends to agree with Hazel's beliefs just to gain profit from it.Haze's car is a major sumbol of the novel. This car becomes Hazel's &quot;church.&quot; Hazel lives in his car and preaches from his car. His car becomes the &quot;rock&quot; which Hazel builds his church upon. He and his car become &quot;one.&quot; After his car is destroyed, Hazel sees himself as destroyed. Hazel is weaned out of his fantasy/rejection world and into reality. He eventually forces himself to Christ as he sees he is &quot;not clean.&quot; He begins his stage of repentance by blinding himself, stuffing his shoes with glass and rocks, and wrapping barbed wire around his chest. Inevitably, his destruction came.This book was very revealing and well-written. O'Connor selects certain audences with the books she wrote. This book contains a majority of religion. A person who perfers not to read about religion probably ought to but will not want to. The way O'Connor incorporated her hidden themes into her novel provided the reader several ways to interpret her implied religious beliefs."
0451215818,The Bridesmaid Chronicles: First Kiss,,AG9CB9Q1A75EN,Madd Witch,3/3,2.0,1173398400,The shallow end of the gene pool ...,"I really enjoyed the series. They are light, quirky romances that are fun to read. This particular book however was not on par with the rest of the series. What really killed this book for me was the lack of romance. The rest of the books in this series are told from the perspective of both the heroine and the hero. You get to see how the attraction between the two characters develops into deeper feelings. They go through a little angst before they get together in the end, but you're rooting for them to work out their issues and stay together. The heroes and heroines all have personal/relationship issues that they work through in order to achieve their happy ending and you see them grow because of it. Not so with First Kiss.The story is told entirely from Kiki's point of view. This, I think, was a big mistake. Not only did we get no sense of deeper feeling from Kiki, who was shallow to the point of causing me more than mild annoyance, but we get absolutely nothing from Fab. Sure, we heard about how hot Fab was, what a good bed buddy he was, and that he knew how to listen to a girl, but what else is there? We don't see anything real developing between them and the one, very short, moment of conflict between them is when Kiki tells Fab that he can't give her any kind of relationship. Then a scant few hours later Fab's declaring his love for her in front of others? And what deep thoughts does Kiki have upon overhearing this? What outfit she'll wear when they double date with the celebrity couple that Fab has declared his feeling to! It was kind of a let down for me to see that Kiki didn't really grow at all as a person during this book. Not that I expected her to do an about face, but if she'd become a bit less self-centered or just given some sense of having matured a little, I would have been happier. I enjoyed Danni, Tiffany Lynn, and Kirby way more than the lead characters, but I really just wanted to brain Suzi-Suzi."

But this is THE BEST GUIDE to find the gate and walk the road IN REAL LIFE.I have read a chapter a day in one sitting and can't wait to start over and do it again. Because each chapter is a sermon, the full flavor of the author's words and lessons would be much diminished by stopping in the middle and picking up again the next day. I plan to record this myself on CDs to play in the car (or, if you know anyone else who has done this, let me know!). I gave up starring the chapters as ""this one is REALLY GOOD!"" because the profundity and ""aha!"" moments are pervasive throughout.This is not one to put on your list of ""books I must have if stranded on a desert island"" because the injunctions are only meaningful if lived out in community. (In fact, the author decries monasticism frequently.)I would have to say as a lay person that the most profound illumination received from my first reading of the book is ""the principle of the integrated whole"" of the Sermon on the Mount. Bits and pieces of it have been thrown at me all my life (""Ask and it shall be given you""), but no one ever related the bits in context. I'm afraid I will violate the intent of the Sermon (to show me HOW to love my neighbor) the next time someone tries that!

Jackendoff has an unquestionably good broad grasp of mainstream contemporary research in grammar and cognitive psychology, and his approach to grammatical theory is way saner than mainstream generative grammar. But he is too dismissive of many things he evidently does not understand, like Cognitive Linguistics (which he calls &quot;combinatorial&quot;, overusing the most overused word in this book), or anthropologically-oriented approaches to language. This is too bad, because he talks himself into a terrible solipsistic mess in his chapters on semantics (where he attacks &quot;formal&quot;, truth-conditional semantics), which, as far as I can see, the only ideas that can get him out are those he dismisses the most casually."

HorngThe book is about Stanley, a boy who got accused of stealing an Athlete's shoes. He was sent to Camp Green Lake to built the characters that he lacked. However, Stanley was innocent, he found the shoes, he didn't steal them. He went to Camp Green Lake anyways and made a lot of friends. Later on he ran away to find Zero, his friend that got banished by the camp. After that, Zero and Stanley came back to dig a treasure. Will they find it and encounter what is by it?I like this book because of its adventures. Stanley and Zero ran away from Camp Green Lake because they wanted to kill them. Zero even said,"" Just leave me and go."" to Stanley. However, they got saved by some wild onions that Stanley found at the mountains. Later on they went back to the camp to dig for a treasure and sure enough, they found it. They also found some yellow-spotted lizards, a poinsonous animal, around the treasure chest.What I don't like about the book was the Warden. She was a very mean person. She even told Mr. Sir to shoot them and Mr.Sir said,"" The lizards or the kids?"" Now that's really mean to me. However, they didn't want to disturb the yellow-spotted lizards so they didn't shoot.My favorite part of the book is when Stanley dot skinnier and when he made a lot of friends such as Squid, Zero, and Armpit.( These are just the kid's nicknames.)

The main character Edmond Dantes is about 21 years old, and for him, life is just full of success. He is a successful merchant and is about to be promoted to captain of a ship. At the same time, he is also about to marry a beautiful young girl whom he has loved for a very long time. But amidst all of these happy things, misfortune strikes, and Edomnd Dantes finds himself to be a prisoner in the Chateau D'If for life. He is a prisoner because he is betrayed by his so-called ""friends"" and rumored to be a servant of Napoleon Bonaparte. However, something miraculously happens, so read it to find out.Although this novel is usually thought of as a story of revenge, it has an even deeper meaning than that. This story not only warns people who betray others, but it also promotes love, friendship, and most of all hope. When the Count of Monte Cristo comes back and seeks revenge, he also meets some friends on the way that move his heart. Some of his friends become poor and have a sad life because of his imprisonment long ago, but they still hope that he will return and they wait for him day by day. The count rewards them in a secret way, and shows how important it is to have hope in one's life even when there looks like no hope. So when you read this book, keep in mind that there is more to it than just vengeance.This book is very pleasant and I finished it in a couple of sittings. It will definitely put you on the edge of your chair and you will hardly be able to put the book down. This book is for all kinds of people, but it is especially for people that think life is hopeless, because as this book will point out, nothing in life is ever hopeless."

It was absolutely captivating. I admit it was long and the furst few chapters seemed slow, but as the story got going the book was hard to put down. Dickens' characters really come to life. He has exceptional powers of description; whether the scene is London or Paris, the city comes to life. I felt like I was right there in the thick of things. I know from my history classes that Dickens didn't quite get the historical details all totallly right, but there's something to be said for dramatic license. He's more interested in the complex relationships, the themes of love, sacrifice, and morality. It's interesting how neither the aristocracy or the revolutionaries are necessarily shown as clear cut ""good guys"" - the characters have a greyness, an ambiguity, that makes the book fascinating."

She has a chapter on Sun Magick which is wonderful explaining how the deities were worshiped in ancient times, the sun mother tradition, sun gods, drawing down the sun, living by the sun and making every day sacred, every day solar magick and working with the different sun energies throughout the day. It is an amazing book and it is packed with tons of information. A great buy I thought."

The second time I read it was in 1977, in conjunction with Joe Haldeman's ""The Forever War."" I finished re-reading it for the third time last night.Each time I read the novel I see something different. In 1965, I read it as space opera. In 1977, I read it as an anti-war novel.Now, as an old man, I found two new readings: one, it is a Freudian bildungsroman wish fulfillment fantasy. Juan Rico seeks a father figure and by the end of the novel he comes of age and is surrounded by the men who taught him and led him to his maturity.In the final battle, in which he plays a small part, he is surrounded and aided by his father,now a sergeant, by Zim, his instructor and now a sergeant, and inspired by the Admiral. They are all father figures and each one aids Rico.And two, it is a story with an unreliable narrator. Robert A. Heinlein was a consummate novelist. Unlike some of the current crop of science fiction writers, he knew how to use point of view. He chose to have the young Juan Rico tell the story. We see every event through his eyes. His interpretations are only as reliable as his immature vision. As we read the work, we must always ask ourselves if Rico's interpretation is accurate or is his vision colored by his youth, by his instructors, or by the military.""Starship Troopers"" remains in print year after year, whereas other novels and novelists of Heinlein's generation disappear. I believe the reason is that it cannot be reduced to space opera or escapist fiction. There is too much going on under the surface: through its speculation and through its characterization of the young fighting and dying for others in a foreign war."

1587240149,"A Kiss of Shadows (Meredith Gentry, Book 1)",,AWXVEPC0DZ8R4,Christopher W. Thomas,27/28,5.0,970272000,"As Done for the Undead and Lycanthropes, so too for Faeries!","* As an avid fan of Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series, I was excited to hear that she was beginning a new series. In reading &quot;A Kiss of Shadows&quot;, I have found that Hamilton has once again captured that unique flavor that crosses the genres. A fantasy book set in a modern day United States, it also contains elements of political intrigue, suspense, elemental magic, private investigation, and sexual elements that push the envelope. As readers we are given a glimpse into the social and political world of the faerie court. In much the same way as vampires and lycanthropes are common to the world of Anita Blake, so to are magic and the faerie courts to the world of Meredith 'Merry' NicEssus. * In the person of Meredith, we are presented a woman of strong will, who walks the fine line between human and something else. As we come to discover the environment in which Merry grew up, we can begin to understand what motivates her. Whether it is her interaction with her aunt (Queen of the Unseelie Court), her aunt's personal guard, her cousin Cel, or those around her in Los Angeles, we find that her reactions adjust to the situation around her. * The aspect of &quot;A Kiss of Shadows&quot; that intrigued me the most, was the manner in which it approaches the good/evil aspects of society. What humanity might think of as evil in human society, Merry might view as necessary to have survived her years in the Unseelie Court. Meredith's views on sex are also rather unique. Because of her upbringing, she lacks a certain sense of modesty that extends itself further into her relationship views. * Never to be outdone; Hamilton breathes life and personality into every character in her books. From the heroine to the supporting characters, and in the case of this book, even things and places like 'The Black Coach&quot; and the mounds of the Unseelie Court. Even the diverse races have their own unique feel. * As you enjoy the rollercoaster ride of emotions &quot;A Kiss of Shadows&quot; takes you on, you arrive at the end with an insatiable hunger for more. If I was eagerly anticipating the arrival of this book, I find I can hardly wait for the next book in the series. * Despite all of the enjoyment I got from reading/experiencing &quot;A Kiss of Shadows&quot;, I was left with one unanswered question. Does this book take place in the same world as the Anita Blake series, or are the similarities merely cosmetic? Additionally, if both characters (Anita and Meredith) do live in the same world, might we some day have them meeting to overcome a common foe?"

It seems more a series of vignettes describing in detail events of war (one could almost say pornographically but this is admittedly a little harsh). There are scenes of wounded horses screaming, a hospital with agonizing amputations, soldiers struggling in the mud... All of this seems there as pure description, almost like biographical journalistic anecdotes - and none are lengthy. The characters surrounding the first-person narrator, Paul, are superficial; the dialogue, at times, sophomoric.I found tenderness and emotion missing in this book. A better view of war is obtained by looking at the World War I paintings of Otto Dix. `For Whom the Bell Tolls' by Ernest Hemingway (although different) is far superior.However, there is one facet this novel does portray effectively - war will cause mental scars that will never heal. War permanently damages all participants."

0786108487,The Awakening,32.95,A3VF2AY025AXKL,Reader55112,8/9,4.0,987465600,Not a feminist book..,"Many persist in saying that this is a feminist book. It is not. This is a book for men and women, it teaches about integrity of emotion. The evidence that the main character is a woman who leaves her husband in a time when it was taboo is really not enough. Was she particularly courageous, honest or good? No. She was simply a vulnerable woman who was victim to her own troubled sea of emotions. Edna is a tragic figure, she always seems to be searching for something.. and she doesn't know what it is or where to find it. Yet the mere fact that she is searching, that she is open to something greater than the trivialities of life makes her an intriguing character. Edna's viewpoint is terribly colored, however. For to her, it seems as though she is the only one with this sensual longing. She never bothers to give anyone else a chance, and chances are, if they're like the rest of us, they've felt a similar pull at some point. But instead of harnessing this feeling, Edna succumbs to it. She retreats into herself and simply gives up on life. She resorts to shameless pursuit of self, she lives to please her momentary whims. She never considers that her husband loves her or that she has vowed to be faithful. Edna only considers that she doesn't love him, and she will make no sacrifices for anyone else as long as her own debaucheric pleasures are at stake.If I were rating Edna, I would give her one star. But I'm rating the book, and I must consider that its overall effect was powerful. That Kate Chopin's diction was lyrical and her imagery potent. That the message of this book, though tainted by the miserable and futile Edna, resounds. This is not a feminist message. It means nothing more for women than it does for men. The message is that we must always strive for the integrity of emotion. That we must force ourselves to reach beyond the superficial in life and grasp the true and lasting. Poor Edna was so close to discovering this, but she abused the longings she felt and misinterpreted them. Perhaps if she'd only had that talk with the doctor....."

B000KOYWE6,The Heart of the Matter,,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,Martin Asiner,10/11,3.0,1156896000,Believability Suffers,"In THE HEART OF THE MATTER, Graham Greene employs some of his favorite themes to show how his protagonists aspire to moral elevation, encounter temptation, and then succumb to that temptation. Chief of Police Major Scobie is another in a long line of Greene protagonists who are surrounded by rot, decay, corruption, and just plain seediness but nevertheless try not to wallow in all that immorality. Scobie is an honest top cop in a graft ridden West African district during the Second World War. For him, the war is a distant affair, one that encroaches on his turf mostly when he has to ferret out Nazi spies, saboteurs, and illegal contraband smugglers. For fifteen years, he has managed to walk a delicate balance between doing his job and doing it too well. Further, though he loves his wife, she has begun to show the classic Greene symptoms of marital boredom. She had been counting on his getting a promotion to District Police Commissioner as a panacea for what she has increasingly come to see as her life being bent back on itself. His promotion, however, goes to another younger officer and while this does not terribly bother him, it most certainly does her. She tells Scobie that she needs a vacation from the humdrum life that he seems to tolerate but she cannot. At this point, several of Greene's themes come into play. A good man with good intentions is placed in a negative and hurtful environment. He sees enemies everywhere, and he is not sure whom he can trust. He is about to make decisions that will take him on a journey that is at least as much spiritual as physical. It is tempting, of course, to equate Scobie with Conrad's Marlow, especially since both Scobie and Marlow are in the same general area of Africa. Unlike Marlow who did not allow Kurtz's evil to alter his moral compass, Scobie is to encounter evil on a more personal, less universal level, with devastating consequences.Scobie's downfall occurs incrementally with the first step occurring when he needs money to pay for his wife's trip. This decision to borrow money brings him into contact with a rather sleazy Syrian merchant named Yusuf who agrees to a loan. In a closed-community like this one where all the thieves know one another, Scobie's loan attracts the watchful eye of a British counter-intelligence agent who immediately guesses the truth but needs proof to arrest Scobie. At this point, Greene's tale is a fairly believable melodrama in which he places both man and land in an arena where the latter is filled with evil and the former is waiting to be infected by it. Greene complicates the plot with additions that do not seem organic to his design: to test man's ability to retain faith. Instead, he chooses to involve Scobie in an affair with a young widow whose only purpose is to further enmesh him in a tangled web of deceit. In the best traditions of the international potboiler Scobie sees no way out but the usual self-exit. What began as a reasonably involving thriller quickly enough devolves into a predictable mess that suggests that for a matter to hold the reader, its heart ought to resonate with more universal, if not believable plot contrivances."

Hocherman,26/27,5.0,953510400,An excellent introduction to John O'Hara's work,"I was interested in reading this novel after seeing the Paul Newman-Joanne Woodward movie on American Movie Classics one evening. To my surprise and great pleasure, the book is far better than the movie -- although it doesn't hurt one's appreciation of the characters to imagine those two talented movie stars speaking their dialogue. At nearly 1000 pages in length, the book requires a major commitment on the part of the reader, but O'Hara never disappoints. His story moves along at just the right pace, and the growth -- or lack thereof -- of his characters is a revelation. I particularly recommend this work to anyone who seriously wants to write a historical novel, because its structure and style are very instructive of how to work in the genre to maximum effect. This book introduced me to a writer whose work is no longer very accessible, either in libraries or on web sites such as these -- and more's the pity for it. What appeared to be a dry, overwritten potboiler of no special distinction turned out to be an engrossing story of one man's desperate search for the love that had always eluded him. I recommend this novel enthusiastically to anyone who finds contemporary popular fiction dissatisfying. And for the average reader, the best part of finishing this book is the knowledge that there's more of John O'Hara's work yet to be discovered."

Cooney ""Kastchei""",1/3,2.0,1318464000,Needs more tricks :),"If I step back into my college nerd-geek mindset, I can appreciate this book for the attempts at humor. To be sure, it's a simple humor, dressed up in pseudo-intellectualism; but it reminds me of some of my friends when they would make an odd comment simply for the sake of absurdity and then try to explain to me how what they said actually made total sense. They were funny and quirky and fun. However, they also had other moods and other traits, and my interactions with them were deeper than simple banter.What this book suffers from is using a device too much. To me, great artists - of any type - have a large toolbox. They may not be masters at using every one, but they are knowledgeable and proficient with each. But most importantly, they know when to use each one - or perhaps more to the point, when NOT to use each one. In Catch-22, Heller picks up one brush (absurdity) and uses it endlessly, repeatedly, for 500 some pages. This isn't masterful, and it almost comes across as an exercise, almost like a musical etude.For me, the trick is not to find something great and use it endlessly. That is sloppy and sophomoric. The real mastery in any art is using a tool only where it has greatest effect, to moderate yourself and allow yourself to use other tools. Otherwise, the effect you are aiming for loses its meaning and poignancy. By being relentlessly absurd - granted some argue he was doing this purposefully to make us feel the absurdity - he's created an absurd book. Kudos to doing what you set out to do, but that doesn't make the book itself ""great"".Just my $0.02."

Steve Derne's book takes this idea and runs with it, using the film industry as a lens for focusing on Indian men's ideas about gender. It's a commonplace that, while people might not talk about their personal attitudes with a stranger, they are more than willing to discuss similar issues in their favorite films, and thus this report (as the very good previous review shows) reveals some surprising insights about how Indian men perceive the construction of masculinity.This book, unlike many sociological texts, is both scholarly and readable, and would make a good addition to undergraduate or graduate courses in area and gender studies.

Morrison's style is very different, but this story begs for that.I do understand that this might be a difficult book for high schoolers, but as a nursing mother myself, I agonized along with Sethe over the separation from her nurslings and the physical ways that separation manifests itself.

B000JKXWKQ,The Mysterious Mr. Quin,,A2SI6BNK5SWSMD,L. J. Roberts,2/2,5.0,1331164800,Christie's favorite characters are mine as well.,"As this is a collection of short stories, there is no one first sentence.Mr. Satterthwaite, although 62 years old, is described as a dried-up man; views on age have changed over time. He is wealthy, loves the good things in life, definitively British and is a keen observer of people. The last attribute increases with each encounter with Mr. Harley Quinn.Mr. Quinn is a gentleman of mystery: Is he real with supernatural powers, or Ms. Christie's very own, and very different version of Holmes. Quinn was, in fact, Ms. Christie's favorite character. In her autobiography, she describes him as ""a friend of lovers and connected with death"". She does allude to the classic Harlequin in ""The Soul of the Croupier"" when Satterthwaite expresses surprise seeing Quinn. Quinn responds ""It should not surprise you,"" he said. ""It is Carnival time. I am often here in Carnival time.""In general, I'm not a fan of short stories, but I find myself frequently re-reading these. I do love Satterthwaite's line of ""I can put up with vulgarity, but I can't stand meanness."" The stories have a slight supernatural quality to them, but always with a logical explanation possible, and certainly to the solutions of the crimes.

B000GR11XM,Great Expectations,,A23NSKTMSPPBTR,Wayne,4/4,5.0,1265155200,What's in addition in this edition,"Since a potential buyer might be wondering which edition to buy, I've decided to give a brief review of the edition instead of one of the story.This is the 2003 reissue of the 1986 edition of the Bantam classic edition. This edition has the 1986 introduction by John Irving. It contains the Dickens classic in its intact form, with the original ending following it separately. It is 528 pages.When Dickens first wrote Great Expectations, it had a different ending. There are some who feel that the original ending is more in line with modern tastes, and that Dickens ""caved in"" by changing the unhappy ending to one that was ""more acceptable."" Some feel that Dickens went too far in order to cater to his audience rather than stick to a literary standard. In the introduction, Irving discusses this issue among many others and suggests that Dickens was not so much driven by the audience as he was in touch with their lives when it came to inspiration. Ideas in literature may seem fantastic and improbable, but Irving points to events in Dickens's life that would seem equally improbable had they appeared in fiction. He also mentions modern real life events that, if put in a novel a decade earlier, would have seemed impossibly unrealistic.Yes, Dickens was an optimist. But the new ending is not a ""happily ever after"" one so much as one that leaves the door open. I can't think of anything more suitable for a book entitled ""Great Expectations."""

B00005VRFQ,Eight men out; the Black Sox and the 1919 world series,,AHJ5FLIDAK7QC,Valjean,9/10,3.0,1210204800,"Nice knitting, but no yarn","That eight members of the heavily-favored Chicago White Sox baseball team conspired with gamblers to throw the World Series in 1919 to the underdog Cincinnati Reds was somewhat in dispute -- until about 1920. After a sensational trial that year and several other investigations the general outline of ""the fix"" became well known, though Mr. Asinof apparently wasn't satisfied. This baseball-loving author was himself born in 1919 and obsessed enough to gather every detail -- and there's *lots* of detail here -- one would ever want to know about the scandal culled from sources still around in the early 1960s. `Eight Men Out' is the noble 1963 result, which addresses every possible *how* one could ever want about this fascinating bit of history. Too bad it suffers badly when it comes to *why*.Simply put, Asinof doesn't tell much of a *story* -- at least in the sense of identifying the various character's motives, the fundamental conflicts, and of course how these are finally resolved. We get a smattering of the main character's backgrounds (including a great nugget of the famous gambler Arnold Rothstein pulling a knife on his adorable brother when they were children because the latter got more attention) and are informed, of course, of Sox owner Charles Comiskey's famous stinginess with player salaries but teasing out the motivation for and ultimate consequences of the fix is left largely in the reader's hands. While I can't find much fault with readers drawing their own conclusions -- and especially from a journalistic account this detailed -- `Eight Men Out' unfortunately doesn't quite stay ""objective."" Perhaps aware that a dry retelling of facts (many of them legal and arcane) makes for a stiff tale, Asinof drops several *hints* to keep his plot moving (e.g., sports gambling was fairly prevalent at the time, many players openly cavorted with gamblers, baseball itself had little to no policing of its players actions) and even makes a few clumsy attempts to recreate obviously apocryphal conversations. (One between Sox manager Kid Gleason and gambling shill Abe Atell is especially painful.)This compendium of detail punctuated with a little narrative color gets the job done: I now know the undiluted who, what, where, when and how of this famous account. But given its renown and continuing resonance through the sports world I was frankly expecting much more. What were the *real* reasons the players got involved -- especially since at least one of them (third baseman Buck Weaver) clearly didn't ""play soft"" during the Series and several received no money at all? Was the baseball establishment justified in appointing a take-no-prisoners commissioner (ex-Federal judge Kennesaw Mountain Landis) who subsequently banned -- for life -- all the involved players from the major leagues? Did baseball itself -- with its cheapskate owners, publicity-seeking officials, and infamous ""reserve clause"" that created near-servitude conditions -- contribute to conditions that tempted the players?Clearly interesting questions to ponder but Asinof doesn't even frame them terribly well, much less ask or answer them directly. As he admits in his introduction, the author had a difficult time getting the involved parties to talk about the scandal -- even several decades later. Strangely, even after a mountain of fact-gathering, he seems equally reticent to directly question this most damaging episode in American professional sports. I finished his book informed of everything and persuaded of nothing. No terrible thing, really -- but to fill out the story I'd strongly recommend John Sayles' excellent 1988 film of the same name."

I came across _Kitchen_, and was compelled to read it. I'm glad I did. Banana Yoshimoto's writing is sparsely beautiful, all at once distant and intimate, in a distinctively Japanese way. The close-up yet faraway look into each character's mind left just the right amount up to the imagination, and the story dealt with death both realistically and sentimentally.

The book showed how life isn't about rushing the whole time, making a ton of money, success in life is not dictated by these things. On the contrary, appreciate what's right in front of you. I'm a sophomore in college now, I still don't have the answers to the world, nobody really does, but I thank Blue Highways for instilling in me a curiousity and drive to enjoy the finer, simpler things in life."

And ...I liked it!Author Salmonsohn presents some basic truths that we've all heard before. (&quot;Relax.&quot; &quot;Let go.&quot;) But she presents these sayings in a context of sophisticated graphics and down-to-earth realism. I especially like her warning, which I paraphrase as, &quot;Don't seek career advice from people who don't have careers, or relationship advice from people who don't have relationships.&quot; It's not completely accurate: some people can &quot;teach&quot; better than they can &quot;do.&quot; But it's worth considering.And her warning that every year has a &quot;winter phase&quot; is right on.Like most readers, I'm absorbing Salmonsohn's words after reading dozens of self-help books, so none of these ideas are really new. I'm wondering if this book would really melt the heart of a cynic or someone who is truly resistant to change -- or if they'd respond like an atheist who is urged to try a contemporary hip &quot;new&quot; religious service.My hunch is that this book makes a great gift and recipients, like me, will appreciate the sender's thought and intention, regardless of the book's actual content.

I have enjoyed Goldsmith's books in the past and was expecting interesting characters and a decent plot. This was a huge letdown.Tracie is a self-centered, shallow ninny (she has the depth of a melted popsicle). We learn very little about her as a person, other than the fact she is attracted to emotionally unavailable men. I couldn't get a clear picture in my mind's eye of what she looked like, something I expect from good fiction.Jon is a stereotype - a nerd in the dot.com IT industry. Do we really believe he would give up his own morals so quickly and bedhop like his hated father did? This did not make any sense and was incongruous with the Jon who was introduced at the start of the book. He was irritating. The subplot with his father's ex-wives was actually quite interesting, but Goldsmith drops it to focus on Tracie's drab, little life.Other cliches: Molly the snappy, mouthy waitress who sees everything and dispenses psychology and philosophy with the alacrity of a talk-show shrink; Phil the bad boy in the band (other than being good in bed, he is poorly defined - Goldsmith could have played up his narcissistic tendencies more. At least he had the potential to be more interesting than the leads.) Laura, another dispenser of common sense and wisdom, proferring farm cakes with support, like a surrogate mother to Tracie (who acts 12 instead of her alleged age) - she has been done dozens of times in the past, and much better than Goldsmith's interpretation.You could see who was going to end up together very early in the book. By the time the ending came, I no longer cared.As for the inaccuracies about Seattle, this is sloppy writing and bad research. Why did she base a book in a city she knew little about? It being in Seattle, other than the high-tech element of the city, was irrelevant to the plot.As for the newspaper stuff, as others have indicated, this was completely out in left field. It might have been more realistic to base this at a fashion magazine than a newspaper. For one thing, she would have been reporting to the Lifestyle Editor for the most part, not the editor in chief or managing editor. Her work schedule was also a joke. And are we really to believe that she ended up with the job she took at the end to get some money? Seattle/Tacoma area is big enough to get a pile of different writing or editing jobs.The book was a hugely disappointing on a pile of different levels. It lacked heart."
B0007DMHZG,Mani,,APQQR9NI511PB,Alekos,8/9,5.0,1091232000,A WORLD OF NOW-VANISHED WONDERS,"MANI ... It is not for nothing that Patrick Leigh Fermor is generally considered the greatest living travel writer in English. Reading any one of his books, always a smooth, elegant and intellectually exciting undertaking, is to accept an invitation to the private world of a master observer of places and manners who is also pretty sharp in such areas of human endeavor as history, architecture, music, theology, psychology, mythology, and languages both classical and modern. He is extremely erudite - an autodidact, he says - and his approach to travel writing is strictly literary and sometimes sublimely so. This book, doubtless conceived as a companion volume to ROUMELI, which deals with Northern Greece, takes us to the southernmost part of the Peloponnesus. Unfortunately, the world of rocks and rustics and supreme beauty it describes is now largely vanished, so it is therefore of great value to have a traveler's vision and memory of it as it was about sixty years ago. Always subtle and elegant, the story takes on a heightened aesthetic and intellectual intensity at certain points and in particular locales. For example, the opening paragraph of the book's final chapter describes the writer's arrival at Gytheio by means of an extended metaphor comparing entrance into a city with the act of coitus, and if any reader should miss this metaphor let me point out the author's use of such words as maidenhead and deflower. A further adornment of the metaphor, conceptual and literary, is provided by the revelation that the little island a few yards off the coast, now named Marathonisi and now connected to Gytheio by a causeway, but called Kranae by Homer, is in fact the island where Paris and Helen spent their fist night after the famous elopement. At another point the reader is invited to watch the dolphins scull down at exactly the imaginary line in the Adriatic where the filioque drops out of the creed. We are allowed to eavesdrop on a group of centaurs on the Pelion Peninsula, and a passing reference to Henry Miller and George Katsimbalis develops into a chain reaction of crowing roosters around the world and back again. There s an excellent chapter on the peculiar little village of Areopolis, the gateway to the Inner Mani, where the author attempts an interpretation of the ancient carvings on churches and houses. This marvelous book will be of interest to anyone who feels attracted to the beauties of Greece and its people, but also to those who enjoy supremely well-written prose."

We are to believe that the Darcy's would have daughter's like these, I find the only truely believable daughter is Camilla, who is a bit like Elizabeth, other than that I have a hard time imagining these parents raising girls like this. I wondered what happened to the Bingley's as I felt the girls would have been sent there first. I don't like the characterization of Mr. Fiztzwilliam, or the Gardiners, who I like very much in the original and can barely tolerate in this story. We are to believe that the Gardiners have more money than the Darcy's, and have fallen into the pettiness of society. We are to believe that the girls have never been in London, but raised in the Country and lacking many social graces.The book would have been better as a stand alone story, with no ties to P&amp;P, that way no background could interfere with the story. If you are expecting a Jane Austin type read, this is not the book for you."

Phoebe is lucky to be alive though she might think otherwise as her husband was DUI causing the coach to crash killing him and their two children. Vowing she will never again be under the thumb of a male, Phoebe cuts off her hair.Three years later, Mr. Philip ""Phizz"" Marston is considered the heir apparent to Brummell as the arbiter of style. When aristocratic farmer David Hervey sees Phizz for the first time ever, he wonders about himself, as he cannot keep his eyes off the man. When Mr. Marston leaves, David can't forget him. This somewhat disturbs David because he has always favored women and has a near adult son born out of wedlock. Soon David realizes why he is so attracted to a male, as Mr. Marston is actually a masquerading female. David begins to ""court"" Phoebe, disguised as Mr. Marston. Soon they fall in love, but he must persuade her that they belong together beyond just the pleasures of the flesh as she knows the tyranny of marriage.This is an entertaining Regency romance starring a delightful lead protagonist and an intrepid heroine. The reactions of Mr. Marston and Lord David upon first seeing one another is priceless, especially that of the confused earl. Though his learning of a plot to harm her seems stretched, fans will appreciate this charming tale.Harriet Klausner"

As many other reviewers have stated, it's pretty much a rehash of Hinduism, Budhism, and also C.S. Lewis. In one of his books, C.S. Lewis states that our only connection to Eternity is now.(Perhaps Lewis got that from the Hndus and Budhists as well, or perhaps spritual teachers arrive at the same conclusion.) And, it doesn't take a brain surgeon to conclude that fear truly is the root of all evil. These same ideas of the ego (lower self) and being in the moment are espoused by Deepak Chopra. Another book that readers might find more accessible is the Tibetan Book of Living and Dying.The ego-- cant' live with it; can't live without it. Since we exist on this plane where the ego is very much present, many of us need a more organized and concrete presentation to satisfy the ego so that we can actually bypass it and become conscious. When something is presented in such an esoteric way, many people who are becoming conscious may not be able to wrap their minds around it. That being said, there are many voices who reach different people. Many find something in this book that speaks to them and that is a good thing. Much of it resonated with me, but that's because I had aleady been exposed to these ideas from other sources. Others will go elsewhere for a voice they understand.

5557096396,A Farewell to Arms,,AEUTSNAA8E8NX,kyaw naing,0/0,4.0,1200873600,Worth it,"In order to express his dislike for war and clearly demonstrate the devastating effects of it, Hemingway wrote A Farewell to Arms. The book has had a lot of fame behind its name; and its contents stand up to its title. Hemingway successfully conveys the stark aura of any war through his depressing diction and images of bareness.The book's plot moves very fast, bringing forth more interest from the reader. It is set in an Italy during World War I. The main character Henry arrives at the war front with an easy attitude. But then the war came; he falls deeply in love with a nurse and the couple attempts to escape the devastating war, failing miserably in the end. It is within mere pages that the main character meets his girlfriend and falls in love with her. This fast moving plot, however, does not mean that Hemingway left out any details. Almost every chapter contains a description of the environment--the deteriorating image of the trees and rivers near the war region. But it is wrong to assume that the book is all about war and killing for there is a good deal of humor and love that constitutes to the plot of the story.Unlike other stories, which are either all Utopian or dystopian, A Farewell to Arms is a hybrid of the two kinds. The ending is very realistic; it is neither sad nor joyous.The Farewell to Arms is a good book to spend the time for. Its being related to war enhances the plot line and makes the book more interesting for the reader. It may not be the best book ever written but it is still rewarding to read the book."

I had been anticipating this new book for quite some time, and sadly to say, I was terribly disappointed. Previous efforts ('Naked', 'Me Talk Pretty..' et al) have caused me to laugh out loud in inappropriate places. Often. Even on repeated readings. With the exception of ""six to eight black men"" (about christmas in another country) which is very funny, the most I could muster was a smile for about half the essays. Several stories were downright unappealing, Especially ""chicken in the henhouse"" and ""the girl next door"". Both had an underlying theme relating to fear of being accused of pedophila. Both left me feeling kind of creepy. If this was a first effort, perhaps I would be more forgiving. All in all it's not a bad book. I just expected better. I'm still a fan, for now...."

It has some good, if not always very understandable, native speakers of various dialects of Great Britain on it -- and without the transcriptions it is hard to grasp all the changes.

Essence of Cat...,"I've been a fan of Brooke McEldowney's ""9 Chickweed Lane"" for some time, and have been hoping it would show up in book form - especially the ""Hallmarks of Felinity"" sub-stream. Fans of the strip need only know that the book contains Hallmarks 1 through 46 (since the current count is around 119, I hope another book's in the offing), and that you want this.To cat-fans who don't know the strip, I recommend this book; each of the ""hallmarks"" encapsulates an all-too-familiar attribute of our feline companions, as illustrated by the winsome Siamese, Solange. Some of the hallmarks are charming, some exasperating, some hilarious. (See Hallmark #12, ""Grace"" - depicting oblivious cat strolling along mantelpiece as bric-a-brac tumbles behind her... Well, OK, maybe that one's hilarious when it's somebody else's bric-a-brac.)It would have been nice if there were more strips included in the book, but it's still a charming, funny collection that I consider a must-have for the cat-humor section of the bookshelf.

B0000YSH4W,The Giver,,A2ZOMVJ93UEE36,Janna,0/0,4.0,1051833600,The Giver Book Review,"How would living in a flawless world of sameness feel like? In Jonas's mind it is a perfect place. No pain. No secrets. No war. It is just as if living a dream. Everyone has a role in the community and is placed in training at the age of twelve. Each year prior to twelve, there are ceremonies. For example, at the age of nine, the child receives their first bicycle. Then at age seven and eight, sweaters are given to teach the child how to put it on and eventually how to button it. Every one of these gifts is meant to teach proper life skills for the future.Well, it is time for Jonas's twelve ceremony. Everyone is excited to see the jobs chosen for each child. As he stands nervously awaiting the announcement of his name, the announcer mysteriously skips his name and moves on to the next. Come to find out, he is chosen for the most difficult and rarest job in the community, to be the next Giver. So, later he begins his training. Jonas works with the Giver and finds out about what the world was like in the past. The Giver tells him that nobody has feelings or emotions, that the only one who can hold the memories and pain of the entire community is Jonas.By transmitting the memories to Jonas, he experiences life like no other. At first it is true pleasure feeling the warmth of the sun melting over head. Then the brutal bloody scenes of war approached. Jonas starts to see that sameness is not good. His friends don't understand why he acts out against them when playing a game of war. They're curious about what is happening to him and his odd behavior. When it is just too much for the Giver and him to take, they devise a plan. Will Jonas make it out of the sameness community? Or will they track him down and have him punished?The Giver is probably a science fiction combination futuristic novel. This book has a very good sense of creativity and suspense. The only weakness is the ending. It does not imply much about what is to happen next. Lois Lowry's writing style is phenomenal because of the excellent detailing work and all around eagerness. I would recommend this novel to ages 12+ only because of the vocabulary and understanding of it."
0671745239,Mama,14.0,,,1/2,5.0,910051200,"Deep, but humorous at the same time...you should read it!!!!","Terry McMillan has done it once again. Mama is a real story of the reaity of growing up in the real world. Mildred is the resourceful, funny, strong mother of five kids that she is raising on her own. She has to go through the trials and tribulations of raising her five children and keeping a steady paycheck. To Mildred, this is as hard as keeping a steady man in her life. I like how Terry makes Mildred the same way a real single, working mother would be while trying to push her kids towards goals that she knows she will not be able to reach her self. I can really relate to Mildred's oldest daughter the way she has to assume the role as the second mother to her younger siblings while trying to live a normal life of her own. That's what makes the story so good, because everyone in the family can read the same story and have a character that they can relate to. Mama isn't told like a Brady Bunch episode, but it tells of true survival without any handouts. The story keeps you wondering what will happen next. I really enjoyed it, and I can't wait to see what Terry McMillan will come up with next. I also recommend Disappearing Acts, Waiting To Exhale, and How Stella Got Her Groove Back."

The three `Empire' novels by Asimov are a great example. All three books are wonderfully written and fill the gap between The Robot novels and the Foundation series beautifully. These novels also give us a glimpse at the state of science in the fifties. If you are an Asimov fan and see any of the Empire novels available for loan or purchase please do so. You will not be sorry. To clear up some confusion on the part of some, the reason these novels are called `Empire' novels is because they take place just before the Empire referenced in the Foundation series began, during its infancy and during its peak. Very much fun indeed.If you want to read them in order read The Stars Like Dust First, which takes place before the birth of the Foundation referenced Empire. Then read The Currents of Space which takes place during the infancy of the Foundation referenced Empire. Lastly read Pebble in the Sky which takes place during the peak of the Foundation referenced Empire."

It was written by Pam Munoz Ryan who dedicated it to her grandmother and also wrote it about her. Though it is a fictional story with 262 pages. Pam Munoz Ryan has also written other children's books like Mud is cake and Hello Ocean.Esperanza Rising is a novel based on a true story about Esperanza Ortega Munoz Hernandez Elgart who is Pam Munoz Ryan's grandmother. The story is about 13 year old Esperanza Ortega; when her father dies she has to move to America from Mexico because of her sinister uncles and of becoming poor. She then starts to work on a farm in California with her mother and her friend Miguel's family. Her mom then gets ill because of a sandstorm and also of depression because her Mother (Abulita) is still in Mexico. Miguel then runs away to northern California to work on the railroad. Will her mom get better; can Abulita get to America, what will happen to Miguel?""Next to Josefina was a girl about eight years old, wearing a dress that was to big and shoes with no socks. Delicate and frail, with big brown eyes, long braids, and skinny legs. She looked like a young deer."" That is an example of how descriptive the introduction of a new character is. Pam Munoz Ryan uses so many vivid descriptions I could see the characters right in front of me. Even the shortest of sentences are very descriptive just like this ""Josefina was plump with a round face. She was smiling waving with one hand and holding a baby in another."" And the longest of sentences like when they introduced Abulita.Pam Munoz Ryan doesn't just have distinguishing descriptions of characters, but also of the setting. I could picture myself there, in that room, at that place. One example is: ""Gentle slopes of the vineyard, leafy green vines draped the arbors and the grapes ready to drop."" And also, ""Their cabin had two small rooms; one half of the first room was the kitchen with a sink, stove, counter, table and chairs. A pile of wood waited near the stove. Across the room there was a mattress on the floor; the back of the room had another mattress big enough for two people and there was a tiny cot. In-between sat a wooden fruit crate, its sides touching each bed. Above it was another small window."" Both of those were very well written with good descriptions.""Aguantate tantito y la fruta caera en tu mano, wait a little while and the fruit will fall into your hand."" Esperanza Rising is a pleasurable book. It has vivid descriptions and is a very interesting story. I recommend this book for everyone. It is written in two languages: Spanish and English. Girls will probably like this book more than boys. This book has won many awards some of them are: Ala best book for young adults, Publishers weekly best book of two thousand, and Smithsonian Notable books for children of two thousand."

Palmer builds on this with his rendition of the story, where you can truly experience the old fashioned dickensian christmas era. Unlike other narrators that summarize this classic, Palmer reads straight from the novel so if you have the book you can follow line by line. The story is told across two audio tapes.

The material presented here covers a range of topics which one would generally have to find in a number of different books by various authors. Although the technical information is basic (that is to say, not complex), this is not a book that was written for stupid people. The presentation and coverage is thorough enough that advanced martial artists and individuals with no specific previous training who would like to build a base of knowledge for no-nonsense self defense training can benefit from reading this book. Although my own background is in &quot;traditional&quot; martial arts, the materials here are remeniscent of the short courses taught to military and police, without the militaristic formality.Each topic (unarmed, knife, baton, gun, etc) includes a detailed theoretical explanation, and then offers photographic sequences to clearly illustrate the points. There is no ceremony, and no wasted space in this book. The ideas presented here are logical, the manouevres straight forward and simple, having been developed with the idea that any person regardless of athletic acumen, whether a clerk or a soldier should be able to effectively apply them quickly and easily. There is sound advice on using every day items for defense, sensible methods of conduct and dress, dealing with violence, and mental training. The authors do not dwell on deep time-consuming philosophical ideas, although as with most martial practices, Krav Maga does have a basic ethical thesis: don't get hurt, act modestly, act correctly, and become proficient (page 3-4). As with every defensive art, the thing which will make you most successful is practice, practice, practice.For history buffs, the section about the authors includes an interesting if short recounting of the training and experienced of Imi Sde-Or, including photos of his father, Samuel Lichtenfeld, and Imi as a young man in Europe (pre-1940), showing an incredible physique developed through athletic persuits including wrestling and boxing (pages 223-227). Sde-Or died in 1998, co-author Eyal Yanilov is his successor. The inclusiveness and price of this book make it an attractive find."

Why not use her for the cover then instead of tricking Macaw owners with a hollow promise. The book has charts (p. 18-22) that are filled with opinion represented as fact. The photos indicate that the author is fond of cheap as most of the cages portrayed are offensively so. She even recommends that Birds be allowed to play with Screws and Bolts for toys. And to add insult to the injustice done to Macaws, there on the back cover is .... a Macaw. False advertisement lady! The books only answer to the posed question &quot;Why does my bird do that?&quot; is that it's suppose to. I would expect a work such as this to be authored by a former Wal-mart pet department employee and not the former editor of Bird Talk.

Never bitter, never placing blame, Charlotte Vale Allen offers a potent look at the insidious permanent effects of her childhood experience. It is a gracious, heartfelt autobiography in which the author not only never names her parents but, in many ways, offers an understanding of the family dynamics at play that is nothing less than remarkable. To read her fiction and then to read this book is to see a very full portrait of a woman with the heart of a lion and a powerful gift of insight into the behavior, not only of others but also of her own self--past and present. It is the definitive book to read in order to comprehend how an extraordinary child coped with an ongoing horror and yet emerged to take what she'd learned and turn it to the good by writing books that always offer viable explanations for what is, so often, inaccessible to most of us.

News, Mon, 15 Nov 2004 4:13 PM PST'SCRAPBOOK' DELIVERS THE GOODS (Headline)By Robert Osborne NEW YORKLiza Minnelli has certainly had her share of publicized woes of late, but something's on the horizon that should cheer her considerably.Scott Schechter has compiled a magnificent book on the one aspect of L. M. that always seems to get short shrift or is altogether ignored these days, i. e.,her years of delivering the goods in front of cameras and on stages throughout the world. That work has won her, to date, an Oscar (1972), three Tonys (1965, '74, '78), an Emmy (1973), a Grammy (1989), two Golden Globes (1973, '86) and an ever-loyal fan base, something Schechter covers in monumental detail in ""The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook,"" in bookstores this month via Citadel Press, with a foreword by Billy Stritch.No stone is left unturned in looking at the career of Minnelli and, for a refreshing change, no stone is hurled at her, either; here, it's strictly Liza's professional life and accomplishments that the author is emphasizing. And nothing goes unrecorded, be it a TV ""Match Game"" appearance on NBC in 1967, a 1987 concert in Stockholm, Sweden, or, this year, singing ""Oscar"" and ""God Bless the Child"" at a private party at the Ars Nova Theatre in New York. Besides being a dandy reference guide for anyone hunting for a Minnelli fact,""Scrapbook"" also includes plenty of interesting info onMinnelli projects that came close to happening but didn't. She was announced, for instance, in 1975, and again in '77 and '79, to star in the film version of ""Chicago,"" playing Velma to Goldie Hawn s Roxie Hart (with, at one point, Allan Carr producing, Frank Sinatra playing the lawyer, NancyWalker as the prison matron and Carol Channing and Ann Miller as competing newspaper reporters); later, in 1992, it was rescheduled but with adifference: Lewis Gilbert was to direct, with Liza switched to the role of Roxie and Goldie as Velma.We all know how that turned out. In 1982, Liza tested for what was to be an ""Evita"" directed by Ken Russell; she sang ""Don't Cry for Me, Argentina,"" causing Russell to publicly comment, ""We had found our Evita""; the entire venture, however, was KO'd until it was finally made 14 years later with a different leading lady. Schechter also lists dozens of other projects thatalmost happened (""Sunset Boulevard,"" ""The Carmen Miranda Story"") and, carrying out the ""scrapbook"" motif, there are miscellaneous color photographs, candids and reproductions of Playbill and album covers and Liza-related ads. One thing comes through loud and clear: The lady may liketo play, but she has also worked.****The NY POST -- ""PAGE SIX"" -- Sunday, November 14th, 2004 :HITS THE SPOT :IT'S not all bad news about Liza Minnelli, who was just hit with a lawsuit by her former chauffeur. At the book party for Scott Schechter's ""Liza Minnelli Scrapbook"" tribute tome, the author announced Minnelli's first theatrical movie since ""Stepping Out"" in 1991. Liza will play an offbeat self-help seminar leader who helps Parker Posey on her quest to find her G-spot, in ""The Oh in Ohio."" It co-stars Danny DeVito and Mischa Barton.****The SECOND Review of ""The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook"" this one by Phill Hall of Boston's EDGE and also to appear in the NY RESIDENT paper in a few weeks :""The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook"" by Scott SchechterGrade: A+by Phil HallEDGE Literature CriticMonday Nov 1, 2004Just from the title alone, ""The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook"" seems predestined to find a place on the coffee table of many gay homes. But forget the stereotypical gay worship of this show biz icon and zoom in on the rich contents. Scott Schechter's extraordinary tribute to Liza with a ""Z"" is brilliantly researched, lavishly illustrated and endlessly entertaining. It is impossible to come away from this book without possessing a deeper love and respect for Minnelli.Schechter breaks down Minnelli's career in a neat manner: a decade-by-decade career-based mini-biography (all scandals are removed from print), followed by a chronological appreciation of Minnelli's theater, film, television, recording and concert careers. Schechter uncovers a wealth of long-forgotten facts and photographs which will delight Minnelli's fans: Minnelli dancing on stage with then-unknown Elliott Gould in a touring company of ""The Fantasticks,"" her simultaneous Time and Newsweek covers for ""Cabaret"" (and you thought Bruce Springsteen was the only entertainer to accomplish that?)The book is also rich with Minnelli trivia, including unlikely appearances such as a concert for the inmates of a Chicago jail (two months after she won the ""Cabaret"" Oscar). There is also an unexpectedly large amount of little-known data on projects which Minnelli either turned down (including the role of Daisy in ""The Great Gatsby"" opposite Robert Redford) or which fell apart before production began (including the film version of ""Evita"" under Ken Russell's direction).Schechter is uncommonly generous to Minnelli, to the point of presenting the most glamorous and flattering photographs available; later-life tabloid photographs which show Minnelli's problems with weight control are conspicuously absent. Yes, ""The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook"" is a love letter to the great star. And honestly, what's wrong with a love letter to someone who truly earned the love of her fans?Citadel Press, $21.95, 228 pages****The FIRST REVIEW for ""The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook""LIZ SMITH : NY Post -- Friday, November 5th, 2004""DEDICATED TO Liza Minnelli's artistry."" That's what it says on page one of Scott Schechter's ""The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook"" (Citadel Press). This is a glossy valentine to the great star, concentrating on her long, award-laden stage, screen and recording career. The sensation of her ""private"" life is not emphasized. Tons of previously unseen photos and plenty of Minnelli minutiae. (Her first reviews, even as an awkward teen, are a thrill to read; she had style from the start!) Flip through this and be reminded that Liza is an artist, one whose commitment to her audience never wavers.****"

Iyengar,"Iyengar is reveered by students of yoga trained by his method, available in Light on Yoga and Light on Pranayama, practical guides that are lived with over the years. No one knows how traditional his methods are because like all else our understanding changes over time. Anyone familiar with Patangali's Yoga Sutras will know how concentrated his teaching is, or rather will appreciate that the sanskrit he taught in was a precision instrument difficult to explain to English speakers with a vast and shifting vocabulary. Patangali was not only a great exponent of yoga but also of sanskrit, the most ancient language still known, precursor of Greek, Latin and most other languages. Patanjali considered the sanskrit word for anything was sound equivalence of the thing itself. A different world, a world of sound and silence it is difficult to comprehend, to enter.Yet Iyengar has entered and lived in that world most of his life.Moreover he has a use of English that enables him to take us along with him. This is not a book to read in a day or two, which would scarcely be possible and certianly totally indigestable. It is a book to get to know in silent study, preferably a page or two a day whilst sitting in one's favourite asana. Everything Iyengar wants to convey and through him Patangali wants to convey is already part of your makeup as a person living in the world of nature around you. The Yoga Sutras were compiled to allow you to be yourself by getting to know yourself thoroughly. Although an alarming prospect at first sight it need not be under such expert guidance.It is hardly conceivable that this book would mean anything at all to anyone who has not even begun yoga training. On the other hand anyone wishing to embark on exploration and improvement of self could read this book alongside Light on Yoga, learning simple yoga at first but gaining early insight into the subject from the Yoga Sutras.Existential Buddhists will need to be tollerant of Iyengar's Hindu worship of idols (eye catching cover illustrations only) and translation of Isvara as God, these are superficial practices he, like Ghandi, adopted as their native contemporary Indian culture, harmless enough, they do not detract from brilliant lives and expositions of perennial philosophy.Great soul, great book, used as intended it is the best purchase you are ever likely to make."
0747568545,Cathedrals of the Flesh,,A305NL60WCJT3K,TC,4/5,5.0,1060300800,FABULOUS!!!,"I thought this was a fantastic book. I bought this book thinking that I'd get a relatively straightforward discussion of the history of bathing, but this is actually much more. The author, a young woman with a taste for adventure, writes about her own experiences as she tackles the problem of how to open a bathhouse, crossing the globe and visiting baths in many countries. But instead of taking a highly authoritative tone from the start, she begins with a naive, befuddled tone, describing how she practically stumbles into the bathing scene, seduced not only by the baths, but by the cultures and places she visits. As a reader, I can see the transformation of the author from a novice to an expert over the course of the book, which to me is reminiscent of some of the best travel writing (consider Bill Bryson's self-deprecatory writing, the feeling that on starting his journey, he is no more informed than you or me). I think this book is only partially about bathing, and equally about getting your imagination captured by something different and exciting. I found it really inspirational, it really gives a sense that there is nothing stopping the average reader from deciding to get on a plane and travel the world to learn about something completely different, even if you don't speak the language or don't have any technical experience. So much bad travel writing condescends to the reader, makes me feel that unless I've lived 25 years in Provence or have climbed Mt. Everest, I couldn't possibly appreciate the world. This book made me feel like, with a little bit of courage and a lot of excitement, even I could explore strange places and meet different people!"

At the same time, it is a fast-paced mystery-adventure, with quite a lot of humor (which is hidden between the lines until one reads the book a second time). The protagonists are not people one would meet everyday, which is one of Atlas' virtues, rather, the characters are the sort of people one would wish to meet at least once in one's life. Rand's heroes were unabashedly heroic.Atlas, despite being an exciting read on the level of an adventure, is more fundamentally a book about ideas. These ideas are introduced not as floating, imaginary abstractions, but in terms of real concrete dillemas similar to those all people must eventually confront if they are to live a productive, fulfilling life.I feel a profound sense of reverence for this novel. Perhaps you will too, or already do."

I am an RN, part of the medical community for which the author has such blatant disdain. I have several concerns about this book, the first that stuck out to me was the assumption the author takes that her method is the correct method, and any other form of birth control, fertility treatments or medical advice are nothing more than an attempt by medical community and society to control and destroy a woman's reproductive system. The author takes a very feminist approach to her teachings and in no way presents unbiased medically based advice. Of further concern to me is that the author has no medical background whatsoever, yet is painting a very black and white picture of fertility, ovulation and reproduction as though she is an expert in the area. Many of the articles cited in the bibliography section of her book are more than 20 years old. Let the reader be aware that this author is simply teaching the FAM method that has been around long before her. She has a masters degree in public health which could be policy for all we know, and a bachelors degree in a field that in no way relates to medicine or science.As a medical professional, I know that nothing is black and white. FAM is a very old method of determining fertility. There are in 2010, many more modern accurate ways of determining fertility. You can not determine without a shadow of a doubt that you have ovulated based on anything other than an ultrasound. The author makes it seem that watching for the signs presented in this book will give you clear cut answers. I can attest to the fact that they do not. Unless you fit into the very black and white examples presented in this book, the clues to ovulation will evade you. I, for instance, had very erratic temperatures, cervical fluid that in no way matched the descriptions in the book, and virtually none of the other textbook signs of ovulation that the author presents. I was left frustrated, and had I not had some background in medicine, would have assumed that I was not ovulating and infertile based on the advice presented in this book. Fortunately, I took her distaste for modern medicine with a grain of salt, and got fed up fairly quickly. I went out and bought an ovulation predictor and just received a definitive objective, science based confirmation that I ovulated. In the end, after 5 months of charting and using FAM, my friend used an OPK as well to nail down her ovulation day and has now received a positive pregnancy test.All in all, I think this book is a good way to get to know your body, but really should not be relied upon as a primary way of targeting your ovulation. These methods are too subject to interpretation and easily missed if you do not fit the textbook examples of what she is describing. There are much more accurate, modern ways to target ovulation and I think the author is doing a disservice to readers by making them feel wrong about using other methods and consulting doctors for help with fertility especially when she herself has no medical background or training."

0374113262,Jane Austen: A Life,,,,10/12,3.0,972691200,Not Quite,"In her 1928 essay, &quot;A Room of One's Own,&quot; Virginia Woolf laments as &quot;deplorable&quot; the absence of a history of British women prior to the eighteenth century. &quot;...at what age,&quot; Woolf writes, &quot;should she marry; how many children had she as a rule; what was her house like?...after all, we have lives enough of Jane Austen.&quot;What, though, was Jane Austen's life really like? What was Jane Austen really like? The 1970s, 1980s and 1990s have seen a veritable flowering of Austen biographies and studies (Marilyn Butler, Roger Sales, Jan Fergus, Tony Tanner, Claudia Johnson) that would no doubt have impressed even Virginia Woolf, by sheer number alone, if by nothing else.David Nokes's biography, Jane Austen: A Life differs from many of the others in its presentation of Austen, not as a staid moralist or a stoic spinster, but as a member of a manipulative and conniving family. To this end, Nokes focuses on the correspondence, not of Jane per se, but rather on that of the extended Austen family and especially Jane's cousin, Eliza de la Feuillide. The book, especially the first half, could just have easily been called Eliza de la Feuillide: The Fascinating Life of Jane Austen's Cousin.This extension is justified in that it does answer many questions about Austen's more adventurous and worldly siblings, relatives and friends. For example, Eliza Hancock de la Feuillide Austen was no doubt the natural daughter of a colonial administrator in India by the name of Warren Hastings. In her early twenties Eliza married a French nobleman, who sadly, was sent to the guillotine only a few years later. Eliza, herself, escaped France with her young son and lived as a glamorous demimodaine &quot;Countess&quot; in Regency London, her life only becoming staid and prosaic after her marriage to the much younger Henry Austen, Jane's older brother and Eliza's own first cousin.Nokes's &quot;novelizes&quot; this biography by paraphrasing the Austen family letters. It is an approach that does not always work, at times sounding quite artificial and contrived. In the book's opening sentences, for example, Nokes's writes: &quot;Bengal, 1773: It is the rainy season in the Sunderbunds. Inside his lonely makeshift hut the Surgeon-Extraordinary sits writing a letter home to his wife in England. The livid orange sun is sinking over this dismal region of fetid salt-flats, swamp and jungle...It is three years since he last saw his wife, and he knows now that he will never see her again. Toil and disease have wasted his body and depressed his spirits.&quot;Much later, in recounting a scene between Jane Austen and her brother Frank, Nokes's writes: &quot;The St. Helena islanders, said Frank, charged so much to passing ships for even the simplest supplies that a couple of acres of potatoes or a garden of cabbages there would provide a decent dowry for an daughter. Jane looked down into their beautiful Castle Square garden and thought of Edward Bridges. Would syringas do instead, she wondered?&quot;Fortunately, Nokes's does focus on the important figures of Eliza, Henry and Cassandra Austen in Jane Austen's life and the role they played in shaping her unique Regency voice. Unfortunately, the &quot;novelizing&quot; of the Austen family letters grows extremely tiresome and quickly becomes a detriment to the overall quality of this book. There are a lot of Jane Austen biographies out there. Although it does have its redeeming qualities, this one was simply not my favorite."

A few great stories are &quot;Never Been Dissed&quot;, &quot;Dear Child&quot;, &quot;A Gift of Time&quot;, &quot;Ghost Mother&quot;, and &quot;Accentuating Differences&quot;. The way teens work out their problems(especially family tension)is interesting and helpful. Now I know I'm not alone and have some ideas on how to deal with difficult situations.

I think the main mistake previous reviewers have made in assessing the Black Veil is blaming this book (which I find is mistakenly categorized as a memoir to appease our label-loving publishing industry) for its inability to live up to their expectations of an average, straight-forward autobiography. It seems to me that Moody, as an esteemed experimental writer, had no such designs for this kind of total recall and those who foist their preconceptions of the memoir upon this book will indeed be disappointed.For the open-minded reader however, Moody has a much more interesting offering. Using himself as a means of reflecting upon the vast scales of life experience, Moody connects discussions of family and friends, alcoholism and drug use, literature and music, to grand themes such shame, criminality, and tragedy in both personal and national identities. Using Hawthorne's story, The Minister's Black Veil as a touchstone, (think Proust's madeleine but more integral) Moody achieves the rare feat of making his particular life story feel universally important."

Too bad the story is rather forced (not her fault but with series romance structure!!)Luke Stewart was in love with Grace Bowes 17 years ago, but she married his best friend and move away. And those embers have remained banked. They flare to life again when Grace comes into to interview for a job. No longer the golden girl, part of a golden couple, she is divorced with a 9 year old son and so desperate for a job and willing to do anything - including learn how to drive a school bus.Romance naturally follows, with Grace still determined to return to the big city once she gets on her feet.Just a little too weak on the reasons why she wants to leave the love of her life for the big city a second time, forcing her characters to go through the motions, instead of letting the plot move them. (The books quick pace is as fault here. With a longer length, she could have devoted more time to this).Luke and Grace are achingly 'real', and she gives teenage uncertainity, of a romance that never dies a strong treatment.A pleasant quick read, with strong, vivid character development.

This time around, the New Gods are at war, demons are attacking the Earth, and characters from almost every period of DC history are in existence at once - in short, the DCU is going wacko. The Justice League, with the help of the Outsiders, the Metal Men, and the Doom Patrol, among others, must solve the mysteries and save the day.Alan Davis' art for this story is absolutely beautiful, and I can't help but feel that he took on this project primarily to have the opportunity to draw as many different and obscure characters as possible, with the story being secondary. While it does get off to a good start, it quickly began to confuse me as it zigged and zagged all over the place. Soooo much happens, but I was hoping that Davis could somehow tie it all together. Well, he really let me down with a conclusion that was too simple for such a huge set-up. The heroes undergo some very interesting changes, and the tension is pretty good, but in the end, I was left wondering what the point of the story was. While there is a ""nail"" of sorts, it is nothing like the focus of the previous book. In short, what I am left with is a book full of pretty pictures and interesting situations, but ultimately, nothing very satisfying."

Partly because there are far too many basketball references which I don't understand, not growing up in the States, and when i read it to myself, I can't pick up the meter and the rythm of the words.I think it is good, but if you know nothing about basketball, and don't really like rap, you, like me, will probably not get what the author intended us to hear.

This story is about a successful team from Odessa, Texas named the Permian Panthers aka (MOJO). They were the best team around West Texas and it was a lot of talk that they might win the state championship. They had all the players and the crowd to help them win. But they had an all-star offensive with players like Boobie Miles, Mike Wicthell, and Jerrod McDougal. But the first game of the season something really bad had happened to Boobie Miles one of the all star players. He had gotten hurt and they did not know that Jerrod McDougal could play. They had to count on him anyway to win. They won there second game. I can't leave out defensive players like Brian Chavez, and Ivory Christian. They excellent players and they led their team to the state championship of 5a football. Where they had to play the Dallas Carter Cowboys. Man were they big. They played a tough and great game. They came up short for state championship with the score being 34-28. I would give this book 5 stars. Thanks for reading my review."

Montgomery ""lordcalvin""",47/65,2.0,1099267200,"Smoke, Mirrors and Buffoonery","Quack science of the most transparent type. This is a planet of almost infinitely variable environment. It is possible to discern significant environmental differences even between areas of close geographical proximity. Diamond ingeniously exploits this near-constant environmental variety as a means of explaining radical differences in the cultural and technological achievements of the various human ethno-cultural groups.The obvious fraudulence of Diamond's methodology lies in its teleological fluidity. For example, if Diamond were to have explored the Western mountains of Latin America and found only a collection of hill tribes, Diamond would explain that the lack of domesticable mammals, paucity of crops and of ground suitable for agriculture had precluded any kind of advanced civilisation. In fact the Indians who inhabited this region domesticated the lama, terraced the rugged hills and, exploiting only two food staples, corn and potatoes, built a vast empire with sophisticated architecture, a complex bureaucracy and an ingenious means of recording information. All of this despite dwelling outwith Diamond's ""environmentally favoured planetary zone"". Of course, this is no problem in Diamond's win-win scenario. Diamond's acolytes simply indulge in a reframing exercise and proclaim that if not for environmental limitations, the Inca would have created an even more sophisticated civilisation.We see the same trick employed in the case of animal domesticability. For Diamond if an animal was domesticated it was domesticable. If an animal wasn't domesticated it was, ipso facto, not domesticable. Africans failed to domesticate the zebra, therefore the zebra is not domesticable. Europeans domesticated the horse, therefore, the horse is domesticable. In support of his argument Diamond quite rightly states that the zebra in its present condition has been found to be untameable. Diamond neglects to acknowledge, however, that the primative Eurasian horse was equally untamable. The horse in Eurasia was first herded as a food supply; it took thousands of years of human selective manipulation to create the modern horse. All sorts of unlikely animals have proven to be, to a greater or lesser degree, domesticable: the lama, the elephant and the reindeer to name a few. These animals are conveniently overlooked. Diamond employs the same one-sided analysis of the exploitability of the flora of the various global biomes. Anyone reading GG&S; would think that Caucasians had stumbled into an eden of fully developed seed crops, cleared farmlands and general year-round abundance. In fact, post ice-age Europe was a land of vast uncleared forests, unfordable rivers, mountain ranges and long, bitter winters. Corn and wheat were painstakingly developed into agricultural staples over many millenia by an ingenious population. Had this population failed to exploit their environment, however, these negatives could easily be invoked in support of Diamond's environmentalist theory, thus scoring another victory for environmental absolutism. Diamond's stipulations for assessing environmental origin resemble the medieval test for witchcraft. Throw the accused into a lake. If she drowns she is innocent. If she survives she is a witch and must be killed. Either way you die.Even if you accept Diamond's theory that Eurasians supposedly favourable environment gave them the stability from which to develop higher cultures, it does not sufficently explain why sub-Saharan Africa failed to develop such fundamentals as the wheel or a system of writing. Why no ox-drawn carts in Africa?Diamond postulates an army of rhino-mounted Africans invading central Europe and then invokes his indomesticablity clause to explain the impossibility of this scenario. How does he explain the actual invasion of Europe by Africans from Carthage mounted on elephants? Of course! Elephants are domesticable! Or at least they are a bit; just domesticable enough, in fact, not to upset Diamond's theory. How convenient!GG&S; is peppered with much peripheral nonsense. Diamond, supposedly a believer in the equality of races, proclaims that the tribespeople of New Guinea are the ""most intelligent people on Earth"" because they manage to survive in one of the most hostile environments on Earth. It would be obvious to anyone less blinded by his own dogma that the skills necessary for survival in a jungle environment would be acuity of vision and hearing, fast reactions, stamina and fleetnes of foot. I don't think that any of these attributes would feature on a university entrance exam.So it goes on. It is difficult to see Mr Diamond's opus as anything more than a vast example of post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy, simple elegant and wrong. If human beings are moulded by environment it is equally true that human beings mould their environments. Extreme environmentalist positions are at best unhelpful and at worst deceitful."

In simple language (without jargon), Fellman explores the roots of our tendancy to oppose one another, to define relationships in terms of winning or losing, conquoring or submitting. Western culture is so dominated by conflict, Fellman argues, that we compete compulsively; in business, in our personal lives, in politics and international relations, we've convinced ourselves that success must be purchased at someone else's expense. Such adversarial thinking, according to Fellman, fuels the war machines and threatens us all. Therefore we need to explore some different way of conceiving relations; we need a model of &quot;mutuality.&quot; Mutuality, in Felmman's schema, describes a shift in both language and perception: from demonizing those with whom we disagree (thus turning them into enemies) to expressing empathy and understanding, from glorifying triumph and scorning failure to recognizing and forgiving vulnerability and frailty. Such a vision may seem utopian, but Fellman's long list of examples suggests otherwise. Within our predominantly adversarial culture, Fellman finds what he calls the &quot;seeds of mutuality&quot; almost everywhere: in religion, education, politics, sports, movies, even in law enforcement. And this is the most heartening (and entertaining) part of his book. Although mainly a work of sociology that explores our culture in depth, Rambo and the Dalai Lama is also a kind of self-help book -- a psychological pep-talk that suggests people can overcome anger, contempt and jealousy, and learn to accept the estranged parts of themselves. This is an important book and a timely commentary on our age."

In one chapter, they talked about Doug(the maincharacter)and how he is in a light tower imaginating that he is waking the town by using magic. Then the next chapter has Doug in the woods with his dad and brother. Since the confusion made the book hard to follow, it didn't appeal to me and most of my fellow classemates that read it. On the other hand, I thought the book had the potential to be very intresting if the flow was consitant. The life of Doug, a 12-year-old boy, is one that I could relate to. The losses of friends and family through out the book is one thing I can relate to. I have lost a few family members, but more than a handful of friends. The way Doug moves on in life is what I to do. So, in a way feel a sort of conection with Doug. It is kind of hard for me to give a review for a book that I really didn't understand but, from what I did pick up from the book was not too bad. I recomond this book to a reader that has a high compotision and can follow non-flowing books.

Rather than following conventional writing techniques, Erdrich offers a short story cycle narrative in which two characters, Nanapush and Pauline, tell a story from two very different perspectives. I will have to admit though, the story is confusing due to this feature, but it also adds a personal touch that sets it apart from other novels. As unique as the novel may be, the tale is clouded with imagery that often leaves readers confused as well as frustrated at certain points. Moreover, the descriptions of Native American life and the events that unfold in the novel seem almost mythical and very unrealistic. This seems to suggest that Erdrich has a certain reverence towards Native American culture and views it with awe and vivid imagination."

That's right-it takes place over the course of a day and a night, and the action can be completely and all-inclusively summarized in only 450 words. However, there are only two ways to get this summary: 1) five or six years of study, or 2) by reading a Cliffs Notes-type book.This book has been fairly assessed as incomprehensible, numbing, nightmarish, and mind-numbing. The average reader will have a excruciatingly grim time completing this book.Still, I am convinced that anyone who reads every word of this book will love and embrace it. Be warned, the love and embrace do not happen immediately. After reading the first 90 pages, I had the worst headache in my life. I could not read for five more days. I hated the next four hundred pages of the book. Around page 500, I began to embrace this beloved work. It took the last 250 pages to achieve a unity and oneness with the book.I'm one of those people who reads the dictionary for fun. Because of this, I know a lot of words that I've never heard or have never read. Ulysses changed that.

Their relationship has to be read about to be believed and even then, you're left scratching your head. Marjorie seemed like a very jealous woman, even though her husband was 25 years her senior, she was exceedingly accusatory of his actions and in turn he would feel the need to write long letters of explanations to calm her down.Dr. Krebs would even go as far as to write her IOU's for small amounts of money leant to him, by her. After his death, she would continue to talk with him as if he were alive and she'd even set a place for him at the dinner table! Don't want to give too much away so I'll end this before I do.As I said, it was a VERY strange relationship, even by Hollywood's standards...Marjorie Main comes across as a real character, both on and off the screen.

The author is very creative in this novel; she uses the literary element personifications through out the whole book. She does a very good job with this by how she portrays the character in the book, (ex: the Queen as a snob). Alice (the protagonist) starts off by following a white rabbit to a hole. This late and timid creature leads her into Wonderland. Wonderland is a place of creation and imagination. The dream like setting gives her the adventure, like a labyrinth. The fairytale like mood in the story gives a sense of fantasy, adventure as she meets and encounters many creatures of the dreamland world. She finds herself lost and goes along with what ever she comes across the unknown world. She finds herself with decisions and she has to make to get to one point to the other. I think that this story has really no point, its just nonsense of fairytale she tells to little kids. She even said that she told this during a trip to entertain three little girls. To me the story was a pointless adventure. Yes, she creates a great tone and mood for the setting yet the body of the story was boring to me.

B000N79P10,Waiting,,A2P4JMEU1R2PKL,Kayleigh Brown,3/3,4.0,1137974400,Waiting for Identity,"Humans cannot understand others until they know themselves. The theme of Waiting is the idea that in society, individuals are constantly searching for an identity, and Lin, the protagonist of the novel, searches the most out of any of the characters. Essentially, he is waiting to discover something that ignites his sense of self.It is crucial to the plot of the novel that the setting be Communist China. While western philosophy focuses on the individual, the concept of Communism values the collective. Therefore, numerous examples in the book show Lin's inability to find his true self, because of the oppressive government. For example, since most literature has been banned in the society due to the cultural revolution, he is not exposed to a myriad of literature. The communist society in which he lives parallels that of George Orwell's in 1984. Just as Orwell proves in 1984, in a Communist society,Lin and his comrades lose their identity due to conformity.Lin looks for some sense of identity in Manna, the woman he is waiting to marry. Manna is a strong-willed individual who waits with Lin for eighteen years of separation in his marriage to pass so that she can marry him. Lin hopes to find some identity in the rock of Manna's personality, but as she changes with time, he realizes that her personality is not as stable as he had hoped.There is irony in throughout the story in the fact that Lin misses the point that it is not the destination in life that matters, but the journey. He is so focused on marrying Manna and living in an utopian that he envisions, that he never focuses on the bits of happiness that he experiences in the present. Lin hopes to find an identity when he marries Manna, but in the end his waiting proves to be futile."

We don't need it spelled out for us. I found Pullman as preachy as any Christian zealot.On an unlrelated note, the emotional dilemma and Lyra's choice at the end of the story could have been charming, but the way it became the central focus at the end struck me as anticlimactic. This, I admit, is just my own taste for a certain kind of epic climax, so I could easily see someone disagreeing with me. Personally, though, Pullman did not convince me that this emotional dilemma could tie up the epic stakes he set in the first two books. (And I certainly hope that the fate of the Universe does not depend on such a choice made by a young adolescent -- what a frightening mess we'd be in if it did!)I gave the book two stars rather than one because Pullman's imagination does continue to impress, though not to the lengths it did in The Golden Compass. The Mulefa are fascinating, and the Gallivespians are intriguing. I missed, however, spending time with Lyra and Pan, as they were what made me love The Golden Compass. (Sadly, they seemed to lose a bit of their charm as they became more ""mature."" I liked the spunky, bratty Lyra!)Overall, I found the book disappointing in its ending based on my personal taste, but more importantly, insulting in its blatant, closed-minded declaration on the worth of a religion. Even if I overlooked the other things about it that disappointed me, the book's refusal to allow readers to decide for themselves what they will make of the religious themes is its Achilles' heel."

He is an author ahead of his time but not so far ahead that his futuristics thoughts are on the brink of stark reality. &quot;Search and destroy&quot; politics are present in our society, at any cost. Patterson creates a scenario in which he demonstrates that &quot;search and destroy&quot; politics cannot become something which defines the character of our nation. &quot;Protect and Defend&quot; is a tremendous novel in which the paradox each character is presented with transcends the individual and reminds us that we are human and are often forced to make painfully personal and human decisions. He reminds the reader that none of us walk through life without error. &quot;Search and destroy&quot; politics, in my view, are disgusting and serve only personal ambition. It can never serve the good of a nation. I feel this book is perfect timing and points out the posissble human tradgedies that can only result from &quot;search and destroy&quot; politics."

1590182340,Understanding The Lord of the Rings (Understanding Great Literature),,A2798LQ4A1VV2M,Ed8r,5/6,1.0,1072569600,Don't Bother!,"Short version: There were so many inaccuracies about the story The Lord of the Rings itself, that credibility for this entire book is undermined.I was curious to see what information had been gleaned and distilled for this short little book. In my local library, the book is categorized as part of the &quot;Adult Literacy&quot; collection: easy-to-read material with instructional or classic value. As a fan of Lord of the Rings, I expected to find no facts that were new to me, but I was hoping for a concise overview that I could recommend to others. What I found was an appalling collection of both explicit and implicit misinformation.I won't attempt to evaluate the chapters on &quot;Tolkien's Life and Works,&quot; &quot;Influences and Sources of the Ring Trilogy,&quot; or &quot;Major Themes Explored in the Trilogy&quot; as I do not have the time to do research and fact-checking for these. But I will address the chapter that I DO know something about---&quot;The Major Characters and Races.&quot;As a former teacher, if a student had handed me a book report on LOTR with as many inaccuracies as the author included in this one chapter, I would have immediately questioned whether the student had even bothered to read the book. I don't think even a Cliff's Notes version would have made these mistakes. No one who knows LOTR would declare that &quot;Aragorn . . . hailed from the kingdom of Gondor&quot; or that it was Aragorn who had &quot;fulfilled the promise of destroying the One Ring.&quot; Only someone who had seen Peter Jackson's film The Two Towers but had never read Tolkien would write that &quot;During the War of the ring, Elrond sends his elves to fight against Sauron's evil hordes.&quot; And only someone who had never read the story of Gollum nor yet seen it on screen would suggest that Smeagol &quot;eventually&quot; [yes, that is the word used in this book!] murdered Deagol.Those are only four of many misstatements in this one chapter. So if the author and publisher allowed so many inaccuracies about the story and characters in LOTR, how many more errors were included in the background information and discussion of the work?I regret that I have to be so negative, but frankly, I'm even going to recommend that my library eliminate this book from their collection."

The action of this book is set in 1138, during the siege of the castle of Shrewsbury by King Stephen, anxious to defend and uphold his claim to the throne of England.

Throughout the book, though, the solving of the murder mystery takes second place to his concern for those still living.As with the other books in this series, Peters' use of language and attention to historical detail draw the reader into the picture of mediaeval Britain. In addition, she has a fine sense of drama, which makes the book hard to put down. This book remains an excellent and exciting read."

It's a world motivated by keeping up appearances and exercising the strictest control over expression of one's emotions -- that is, if one is to preserve one's status as a proper member of the upper middleclass. Indeed, the only safe emotion is curiosity about how much others have paid for their possessions and whether they are to be congratulated or envied for acquiring something for nothing, or shall they be sneered at and ridiculed for having paid more. The Forsytes are a commercial bunch, everything boils down to financial value for them -- even relationships bear price tags.Old Jolyon is patriarch of the Forsyte clan. Unlike his brothers, he is now scornful of that middleclass ethos they so highly value, often to their detriment. Old Jolyon has lived long enough to regret his deference to appearances, which had cost him his relationship with his only son.The author's indictment against the stern, uncharitable principles cherished by the British upper middleclass is peppered throughout the narration, the characters always replacing any thoughts toward generosity with sound justification (read: excuse) for niggardly self interest. We are used to categorizing characters as victims, villains and heroes. However, in this story it can be argued that everyone is a victim; there are no real heroes or real villains. Because of his unsympathetic nature, cousin Soames might appear a villain, but truly he is as tragic a figure as Mr. Bosinney (the fiance of June, Old Jolyon's granddaughter) who is in love with the tragically beautiful Irene, Soames's wife. Although the reader is generously privy to the thoughts and feelings of the members of the clan, including disagreeable inlaws, it is noteworthy that the reader is only aware of the two tragic characters, Bosinney and Irene, as they are observed by others. The author never allows the reader to trespass directly into their souls to expose all therein. Fortunately for us, these two wear their hearts on their sleeves and others are thereby enabled to read volumes simply by taking advantage of brief observations. We see the reactions of Irene and Bosinney, never their internal motivations.The title of this book begs the question, exactly who is the man of property or to which man of property does the title refer -- and what exactly is the property that is referenced. Ultimately cousin Soames is the man specifically identified in the title, and surely the property particularly stressed is his unyielding wife, the incomparable Irene. Irene is so much the sophisticated lady, so beguiling in appearance and manner, I am reminded of Jane Austen's ""dear Jane Fairfax"" (""Emma"") who, like dear Irene, has no money of her own and therefore is compelled to select between the lesser of two (or more) quite unattractive situations. For certainly, when one's station is so reduced, being without the means to _choose_ between this pleasant possibility and that pleasant circumstance, one simply must _decide_ which evil will produce the least harm. In The Man of Property, everyone is selecting -- sometimes their choices backfire and then they must decide the next step. June happily _chose_ to become engaged to marry Bosinney, but later she has to _decide_ how best to keep him or even whether she is at all capable of keeping him.Bosinney also brings to mind another brooding young man from literature -- Mr. Ladislaw of George Eliot's ""Middlemarch"", who also was tragically in love with another man's wife. Indeed, when reading the description of Bosinney's high cheek bones, casual manners and the intensity of his emotions, one might be tempted to cast the actor Rufus Sewell in that role; for Sewell's portrayal of Ladislaw was quite memorable in the Masterpiece Theatre television adaptation of ""Middlemarch"", another story about keeping up appearances and making happy choices or miserable decisions.The Man of Property moves along very quickly. The author's descriptions of the lifestyle and environment of that time are quite detailed. But for the selfish and unpleasant people who populate this world, the sensitive reader might easily drift into this other time and other place, which for this reader is the mark of a truly rich literary experience."

Where do I start?...it leads me to ask the question, what in the world was this publisher thinking? Boettner's book stands upon the rantings of unhappy Catholics and the anti-Catholic works of people such as Paul Blanshard and his ilk. Relying upon such people is like relying upon your political candidate to tell you all the ""great stuff"" about their opponent! Blatantly unbalanced, Boettner theatricizes a parody of the Catholic view and simply refutes that. Sadly deficient.It is unfortunate that this man did NOT do his homework when writing this unbalanced work. In the words of Karl Keating, ""But he was not as interested in accuracy as in sensationalism, which is always the enemy of truth. This story is such a great blow against the Catholic Church-why spoil it with the facts?""In my fact finding perusal at the library, I came across Karl Keating's book CATHOLICISM AND FUNDAMENTALISM.

Having read (& reviewed with gusto!) the principal author's two earlier pieces of work i.e. Mapping InnerSpace, I find this book to be somewhat of a letdown.It is natural that I would compare this book with `Mapping InnerSpace.' Much of the material in the new book has apparently been rehashed from the earlier work. The only new stuff I can find is the `symbolary' of easy-to-draw iconographs, which is now been re-organized from A to Z, & a handful of new `Mindscaping' application templates in the last chapter. That's it.Surprisingly, the authors even continue to make use of the same Foreword, which goes back to the late 80's & which appeared in the first book.I get this funny feeling that the new book has been based on perfunctory desk research & no attempt has been exerted to conduct some real field research to cover new developments or advancements. Worst of all, & sad to say, the material is still restricted to the authors' own limited field of work.Based on my own exploration, the field of visual thinking has obviously made tremendous progress in the last few years, in both the educational & business arenas. A quick search & browse across the net will give readers a good appreciation of what has happened/is happening out there.I actually expect the authors to provide a quick round-up (or snapshot) of developments & happenings with regard to new & exciting visual thinking applications across the educational as well as business realms. There have been abundant application variations as well as radical enhancements in the field of visual thinking for business professionals. I am well aware that field research is no easy task in the light of many proprietary methods, but with a little ingenuity & persistent legwork, it would have been rewarding for both authors to go the extra mile. The new book, taking into consideration the prevailing developments outside their own sphere, would have been great for all the readers, especially the professionals.For examples, the creative work of heavy weights in the field of visual thinking as applied to business & industry, like Jim Channon (large system imagineering with Advanced Visual Language), David Sibbet (graphical visualisation of organisational change with template-based methodology) & Matt Taylor (creative augmentation, with artful integration of visual space technologies, collaborative environments, & knowledge-intensive work processes), to name a few, have not been captured &/or exemplified. Not even in the Resources page. I am also very intrigued as to why the innovative work of Christine Allen Ewy (Teaching with Visual Frameworks) & Elizabeth H Wig (Map It Out: Visual Tools for Thinking, Organizing & Communicating) is not even captured in the Resources. There are many others.In today's technology-savvy world, there is no mention of using technology to augment one's visual thinking approach. The Mind-manager software quickly comes to mind. Xplanations is another innovative one. There are many others, too.In these respects, the book does not stand up to its title, Visual Thinking: Tools for Mapping Your Ideas.For the beginner, particularly a teacher or a parent or a student, who is currently looking for plain visual thinking approaches, this book still stands as great work. I would attribute this to the wonderful symbolary.To sum up my review, I reluctantly rate this book a 3 in the light of my foregoing comments, although it deserves a 5 in terms of useful & practical learning for the beginner in the field of visual thinking."

B0006DIZ0I,The Promise,,A2YF4ZMECJVLK9,D. Cloyce Smith,2/2,5.0,1243036800,"An ""exercise in intellectual confrontation"" presented as impassioned drama","During a 1986 lecture Chaim Potok reflected on his fiction, and he addressed specifically the secular-religious conflict of ""The Promise"": ""Danny Saunders chops up Freud, and Reuven Malter chops up the Bible and the Talmud, each for his own convenience. Is this an intellectually honest way to proceed?"" Potok's answer was tentatively in the affirmative, noting that ever since the Age of Reason, writers have reached to their pasts and their frontiers to enrich the present: ""We pick and choose those elements of that alien culture toward which we feel a measure of affinity.""Familiar to readers of ""The Chosen,"" Danny and Reuven continue on the paths that lead them both to embrace and to challenge their heritage: Danny as the Talmudic wunderkind turned psychologist and Reuven as the more worldly youth studying to be a rabbi. But there are other stars around whom the students orbit: Abraham Gordon and Jacob Kalman, two scholars whose approach to the Talmud and to Judaism--and to life--represent bitterly opposing extremes. The liberal Gordon is a friend of Reuven's family, and the Orthodox Rev Kalman, a refugee from the Nazis, is the tyrannical teacher who has the power over Reuven's future. The intensely personal dramas of all three families--the Malters, the Saunderses, and the Gordons--become intertwined even further by the presence of Gordon's son, a deeply troubled boy whose experimental treatment is supervised by Danny. Like its predecessor, ""The Promise"" is as much about the impassioned tensions between its characters as it is about cerebral disputes over secularism and faith.Potok acknowledged that both ""The Chosen"" and ""The Promise"" were ""essentially exercises in intellectual confrontation."" It must be said that the later novel's arguments--their premises, their presentation, and their resolutions--are almost too pat for such an exercise in fiction, and its characters all reach moral and emotional reckonings that seem to be based more on a Talmudic-like calculus than on the rough and tumble of real life. Nevertheless, ""The Promise"" is riveting and powerful and provocative, and the reader is enriched by and grateful for the uncertainties it raises rather than the dilemmas it resolves."

B000H88J30,The Wonderful Adventures of Nils,,A2DAAPYZTJ9PZA,C. Moon,37/39,4.0,936144000,A classic stumbled upon accidentally.,"Though this story easily deserves 5 stars, it suffers slightly due to the author's agenda (she was commissioned to write a geography book for children). Knowing this, it is easy to hurl criticism at those chapters that seem to exist solely for the purpose of education. Nonetheless, once this minor fault (and I am not really sure you can call it a fault) is recognized, the story of Nils is a fantastic one, seemingly not at all distant from native folklore and fairy tales, rich with an earthiness that simply doesn't exist in modern children literature. Of course, Lagerlof does more then simply make a modern day fairy-tale. There are passages here that are simply too delightful for description; one which comes to mind is a gathering of all the animals to celebrate the coming of spring--the image and significance crafted by the author are bound to stay with the reader for a life-time. I haven't read anything else by Lagerlof, and only found this book by accident at a local vendor. If I have any complaint it is that Dover does not offer the sequel to this work (at this writing anyway), though apparently another publisher offers it at a much higher price. I think anyone who enjoys folktales/folklore and whimsical animal fantasies (I.E. Wind in the Willows, the Moomin books, etc.) will find this book very rewarding and enjoy the opportunity to read an unknown classic (in Sweden, Nils actually appears on their money!)"

Twain is wonderfully funny, yet his scathing social commentary concerning his own times are as serious as a heart attack.When a Connecticut Yankee gets sent back in time to King Arthur's Court, he decides his superior knowledge should be used to educate such an ""ignorant race."" Of course, we all know that the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and if I didn't know better, I would say that the person who coined the phrase did so after finishing this novel. The story's main character, Hank Morgan, is a likeable, if not laughable character, yet as most of us already know: absolute power corrupts absolutely. Once technology gets on a roll, the beast of civilization takes off running and Morgan cannot pull in the reigns. Total disaster ensues (incase you had not already guessed).This was a fun read and a look at a problem that is still very much alive today. Too much civilization can be like a disease, especially when those who are working to spread it find that they are doing it for reasons other than altruism.Also, do you remember the scene in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" when Indiana Jones whips out his gun to shoot the sword-wielding Sultan? That scene was surely lifted from this very book!Trust me, this is a novel for thought, but one that will not bore you. Twain was a master and this is perhaps my favorite of his novels. Very highly recommended."

And as other reviewers have noted, most of the recipes can be made within 30 minutes, with those that take longer marked with a funky clock icon.

He explains things thouroughly but not so thouroughly that you fall asleep or give up. Meditation is not easy, it takes time and much effort. He attacks most of the questions that biggining meditators ask. He goes through positions, exercises, modes of thinking, etc. He explains that meditation can be a tool to become more mindful of your existance on this planet. To pay attention to the present and train your mind to overcome the emotional tides that can cloud your vision. No hokey, no false promises."

She 'see's it...but she doesn't *know* it. She writes from the point of view of Anne, who is the young Christian girl in question, and no where is there a reference to any running dialogue between this girl and God himself. She doesn't talk to God, only about God...there is a lot of talk 'about God', but no personal interchange between God and her. And that just isn't the way it is. I don't know any real christian who doesn't have a simple running conversation with God. 'Good morning God, thank you for today""...'Did you hear what that person said Lord? Forgive him..."" or any acknowledgement of a simple awareness of his presence...which is part and parcel of the christian experience....if you really know God.And because the book is supposedly about faith and how it is tried and shattered in tragedy I should think the book should at least start from a faith that is a real faith.The reality is that these people really did have a very simple faith, and a simple faith includes dialogue with God. And this town really did exist, and they were extraordinary people...Then there is the way she took a real characters that really existed and totally maligns his personal history. She justifies this by saying she changed his name and made her own rector up. She takes a huge twist of character and causes Michael Mompellian to turn out to be a monster, not a saintly Christian that he was, and in the end poor Anne is shattered of faith, used and abused by him and finds refuge among the gentle 'peaceful muslims' sheltered in a harem, but with 'no faith at all'. I found this shocking and contrived.ok...I know this is a major spoiler, but the ending was too outrageous and unrealistic, ESPECIALLY when in her own words Brooks points out that she modeled Mompellian after a real rector (a rector Mompesson) of a real town that really had the plague, and she owns herself that he was truly saintly by all accounts, yet says she ""envisioned a man powerful conviction and charisma. Such personalities are *sometimes governed by unwholesome motivations, such as belief they are God infallible instruments. They can be dangerous, even deadly"" end quote.So because she couldn't understand the real life historical rector who was a truly saintly man who really lived and suffered and was by all accounts good....she made up a monster to fit her agenda to smear Christianity. She judges these people while pretending to not, by making they weak and sniveling, dishonorable in every way. ...and blaming it on the Christian background....but I wonder if we placed a lot of secularists in such a town how they would endure.It will be a frightening and interesting thing to see if such trials are visted apon our modern secular America, what would happen.That is all this book was: a smear job.Whether it was intentional...I will not judge...but I will point out that Ms. Brooks knows less about the interior life of a real Christian then the poet of her book knew of the sea."

I was intrigued by the reviews and what I found was beyond any hopes I had for this book. I was touched by the courage and selfless love this man had for both his sister and ulitmately, his niece. He gave without asking and saved at least one life.The combination of humor, outrage, frustration and the senseless madness any child puts a parent through, will resonate with anyone who has actively parented a child. The amazing thing though, is that here is a man who, admittedly had a very enjoyable single lifestyle. His visual of hopping on top of a pool table to say goodbye to it all is both funny and sad, but above all loving and fearless in his desire to save his niece from herself.The author paints a picture so well, you feel as if you know him.

B000H6F27I,The Blood Countess (SIGNED),,ABJ5B33ZAK1XU,Rowan Mullen,14/18,4.0,961459200,Disturbing and Fascinating,"If nothing else, this story will remain imprinted in my memory throughout my life. &quot;The Blood Countess&quot; is absolutely the most graphic book I have ever read (and I've been reading horror/gothic/sci fi for a long time), and yet, through all my disgust and horror, I found myself unable to look away from the scene written before me. This, I finally concluded, was not necessarily because of the innate urge for humans to gawk at car accidents and watch Jerry Springer, but because I was curiously attracted to the mad genius of Elizabeth.Although the modern-day secondary story annoyed me with its shallowness and (mostly) irrelevance to the &quot;true&quot; plot, I truly admired the author's writing style, and the few moments of insight into Elizabeth's psyche touched me. Please, gentle reader, do not think that I would release a monster from its due blame - but I nearly cried the few times the Countess actually showed her vulnerability. How alone, how lost, how angry she must have felt to do such things! Her vision of reality was so skewed and disjointed that I felt I must mourn for the genius that could have done so much, but instead felt compelled to cause suffering.The use of sexuality is extremely powerful in this novel. In my darkest dreams and nightmares, I could never have conceived of such horrible torture, and at the same time the sexual naivete of Elizabeth. The fact that so many of her victims were tortured and murdered sexually simply adds to the disturbing image of the Countess. The reader can clearly see each point at which the Countess is faced with a glimpse of her own fragility and humanity - she wavers on the brink of self-understanding, then the madness rips it from her and she resumes her ritualistic pasttimes with a newfound viciousness.The author's perception of European witchcraft during this time in history is rather interesting - those who are familiar with &quot;The Burning Times&quot; as they are called in the neo-pagan communites may be shocked and horrified at the idea that women during this time had indeed incorporated the Devil into ther rituals and spells. It disgusted me, too, at first. A couple of things saved this plot-device for me: A) this is a work of (mostly) fiction, and B) It makes sense that after a few hundred years of being told that midwifery, herbal lore and women's spirituality was evil and wrong, that the women would come to believe it as well, whether they practiced it or not.On the whole, a great story with a lot of filler. It seemed to me as if the author threw the &quot;real-time&quot; scenes in to fill the story to novel-length. This, I found disappointing. I should have just skipped over these parts, because they seemed unrealistic and flat.I honestly do not know how much of Elizabeth's story is historically accurate. It may be that this novel is all fabrication and assumptions - but knowing nothing about Hungarian history, I found the intricate details fascinating. The story has a great flavor - although the explicit violence and sex may leave a bad taste in your mouth."

B000EFIY18,An American Tragedy,,A1LIX0X8GNMTVE,Joanne Marinelli,0/1,5.0,1281830400,An American Masterpiece,"Some things the literary reader should look for in reading and studying An American Tragedy are as follows:a. The lessons Clyde takes away from Esta's pregnancy seem to have no bearing on his lack of empathy for Roberta once she conceives. He understands the social stigma attached to a child out of wedlock, but he never learned to accept responsibility for his conduct out of those circumstances. As Dreiser indicates just before the Lycurgus section of the novel opens, Clyde ""never learns to grow up"".b. In his relationship with Hortense, particularly towards its close when she wants that coat from the merchant, (location 2181) we see that Clyde learns to associate desire, if not real love for another, with material augmentation, as Hortense herself has long been there. The same thing occurs later with Sondra Finchley, who is perhaps intentionally given the name of a flitting little bird-- and this is as much the dark side of the American Success as is its inability to rectify the hardship of poverty in a capitalist society. This may not be precisely what draws him to Roberta, but he winds up defining his relationship, as she comes to realize his presents to her doesn't mean she has his affection.c. The unethical conduct of Mason's subordinates is dated, by today's standards, but it does unfairly impact the justice that Clyde receives, which might have gone to life imprisonment had the evidence not been tainted and the anti-Mason juror pressured. Dreiser is also very good at looking at the ripple effect of Clyde's crime on everyone else, including Sondra and both branches of the Griffiths family-- but despite his *evil* as the Reverend McMillan sees it, Dreiser never loses sight of Clyde's humanity, and the hardship that shapes him, and this is a very difficult thing to do in a literary work, and as such carries a powerful impact, maybe even more so than Sister Carrie. I cannot think of any thriller that offers us such an interior sympathy for its villains, except for an author like Simenon, but the French are willing to take chances with formula that most American franchise authors will not; in that sense Dreiser's work is not only still relevant but a seminal achievement. [I apologize for keeping Whispernet busy with this file; I want the room but have many things I'd like to say about the novel, although I am not ready to launch into a critical essay!]"

A comic by professional, Hawks is a gifted writer that brings his travels and the people he meets along the way to life, providing plenty of laughs along the way. He is also a philosophical advocate for a positive attitude. While he recognizes that the source of his optimism stems from all the opportunities he was provided where he was born, the contrast with the dour Moldovans provides for lots of cross cultural tension. A truly enjoyable read whether you're planning to go to Moldova or not. Recommended."

I couldn't disagree more with the reviewer who infers that the book is a piece of propaganda. The Wrong Man isn't a love letter to the IRA, far form it. Instead it is a genuine attempt by the writer to shine a light on the conflict between Republicans and the British. The Republican psyche is explored in a warts-and-all expose. Republican violence is neither stylized, romanticized nor justified -it is what it is. Morrison gives us no heroes; we have ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances which for me was the strength of the book. The battle to maintain a normal loving relationship felt much more important and essential than the battle between the British Army and the IRA. Morrison explores gender and gender roles superbly. The writer is obviously close to the subject matter and this is what gives The Wrong Man its authenticity. I have read many enlightening books about the conflict in the north of Ireland, this is yet another. SC"

I felt the sea islands and the smell of pfluff mud as I went with Amelia on her wonderful journey to her home place, a simpler way of life not without hardship but more connected to reality than the world she left behind in New York.Julie's writing beautifully describes the people and places, the essence of the foods, the inner feelings and secrets of her characters. Once I got into it I could not put this book down. This book should be required reading in all schools, so that the generation coming up will learn about the places they come from, the sacrifices and atrocities that took place, the importance of staying tied to one's culture, one's roots."

When I first read this book, I must admit that I found it hard to accept the doctrine of calvinism. Like many Christians in the charismatic churches, I was taught that I could lose my salavation, that Jesus Christ died for every person, and that free-will triumphs over God's sovereign will. Even so, this precious book has made me reconsidered my arminian beliefs until finally I began to see that salvation is from the Lord from the beginning to the end. How God has caused this book to impact my spiritual life is beyond measure to me. My whole outlook of life has changed dramatically, now that I know that He is in control of my life and my salvation. To Him alone then, be all the glory."

Many people have heard of Dale Carnegie's most famous book - How to win friends and influence people. I read it many years ago and have just finished it for the second time; along the way I've been reminded of things forgotten or learnt things that now seem more relevant than when I ignored the principles in the first reading.Ultimately this book is about how to be nice - and to still obtain the results you want. Some people are under the impression that being too nice can encourage the door mat feeling. Not so. This book, along with any other books on etiquette and manners, shows that thinking of the other's person point of view/feelings/loss of face, etc before leaping to conclusions/criticism/complaining is a much better course of action with a much better outcome for all. In the words of Mr Carnegie, ""...the only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it."" It may take a little bit of practice and effort but it surely does work."

Every day he combs out his volcanoes, waters his flower and watches the sunset. One day he decides to visit earth and has many experiences with what we take for granted. While the story is entertaining and child-like, the message delivered to the reader with each encounter teaches the reader many life lessons. The Little Prince tells about the importance of friendship and real happiness.The Little Prince gets five stars because it was a great book. The book did not get bogged down with complicated, adult ideas. The book took a simple approach to what really matters most in life. The Little Prince sees the world through child like eyes. He is always questioning people and getting to the main uncomplicated ideas of life. The Little Prince teaches many lessons. The book teaches about love, friendship and true happiness. It also teaches to not take things for granted. The Little Prince is a five star book because it is not only meant to be a children's book, but also an adult's book.If you like this book, I would also recommend reading The Precious Present by Spencer Johnson.

Believe me, you don't want non' of this in public! This is definitely a `hoot' aloud book. Pat G'Orge-Walker serves up the laughs in her hilarious book, ""Sister Betty, God's Calling You Again,"" about the dysfunctional church folks in your congregation and mine, whether you belong to a Mega Church, or the Friendship Baptist Church on your local main street.I've belonged to both, having traveled the world with a military spouse. That's why this a special joy. It takes the reader home.Sister Betty receives a call from God himself. Her transformation comes through a series of hysterics, learned lessons and self-reflections. The characters are so familiar. You can't turn a page with being able to relate to one of them.Seven stories; cleverly signifying the biblical realm. Seven churches and Seven Seals; the most heralded number in the Bible. Well, this is seven, very humorous stories with monumental lessons, told candidly and honestly, using church-parody.Pat G'Orge-Walker cleverly takes on a niche' not many can, in making real, poignant statements about the superficial antics of church folks. She takes on the art of church hypocrisy to a real eye-peeling level. Walker is quite a descriptive writer, which easily makes this book more pleasurable, because you can definitely see and hear her `busy characters.' Several members of our book club emailed to say that they loved the way she fashions hats to reveal subliminal messages about situations and characters. Reading ""Sister Betty, God's Calling You, Again,"" is like sitting in front of a sitcom.Debra Whitmire, SAblack online book club member. (Now living in Oklahoma.)"

RENTZLER,0/0,4.0,1293235200,"A Comedy of Class, Manners, and Errors","I was assigned to read ""The Rise of Silas Lapham"" as part of my Gilded Age class. The novel follows the rise (and fall of the titular character). Lapham made his money from mineral paint and as part of the new-rich he seeks to raise his social status by building his dream house in Beacon Hill, Boston.To complicate matters there is a suitor for one of his daughters who comes from an old-money family. Their is a supper party that is filled with gaffs as the ""country-bumpkin"" Laphams try to make their way through ""high society"". Including a scene of the normally prohibitionist Silas getting rip roaring drunk.There is a fall and a redemption in this book. William Dan Howells wrote this book as an antidote towards the more sentimentalist novels that were produced at the time. Though the dialogue to a modern audience can seem stiff at times, you must realize he was trying to move towards a more neo-realist form of fiction.This novel is highly recommended for class assignments for: The Gilded Age, Post Civil War America, Capitalism, and Social Class Divisions, and Comedy. The forward was well written, and the included extra material of ""racist"" language which was toned down between when this books was published in serial form in the ""Century"" Magazine was most enlightening."

Many characters play but, may be as pointed out by the title, the deeper story is the one of his father. The father to son difficult relationship is usually present in most Kureishi's works but in no case with such an intensity. The collapse of a family, its impact in the lives of many people including the character are ,in my view, the essential part of this novel. Karim's father character with its deep contradictions, his ups and downs is absolutely the best of the book. Their relationship is described throughout the novel among funny anecdotes of the life in a London suburb."

0030353734,Principles of Modern Chemistry,,A3ABLISIQ90DXS,Athena_Wiles,25/26,4.0,1216166400,a slightly different take on general chemistry,"This book is not as approachable as many general chemistry books; as a previous reviewer has noted, this book is written by physical chemists and the organization and presentation of the concepts in the text reflects this. As a physical chemist, I generally like this text; however, I acknowledge that it's not for everyone and I do have a few critiques.Students who are not mathematically-inclined will have a hard time with this text: the thermodynamics section, the derivation of the kinetic theory of gases, and some of the derivations of the quantum mechanics material are intimidating! However, students with a firm grounding in math and physics will get much more out of this text than they will out of other standard general chemistry texts like Brown and LeMay (Chemistry The Central Science Tenth Edition).I would strongly recommend this book for students who have an interest in math and physics or who have already taken an introductory chemistry course and want to understand the phenomena described at a more detailed level. For AP Chemistry or for students who haven't taken intro physics or intro calculus, I would instead recommend the Brown and LeMay book. I feel that its coverage of some of the topics is a bit more superficial, but it is more approachable for students taking chemistry for the first time.One last note: I dislike the newest edition of this book because they authors reorganized the chapters into a ""quantum first"" presentation (quantum mechanics is introduced in chapter 4 rather than chapter 15 as it was in the 5th edition). While this organization is suitable for some full-out physical chemistry courses, it is not appropriate for this book. If this book is to be used as a general chemistry book, consider doing the chapters out of order: start with the history of chemistry chapters, skip to the thermo stuff, and come back to quantum later. It's much easier to grasp intuitively if you work from the macro to the micro and not the other way around."
B000HFLG5Q,The Physics of Immortality,,,,12/24,3.0,959472000,"Entertaining, thought provoking...and wrong.","If Tipler's magnum opus wasn't so long and jam-packed with incredibly detailed (although somewhat fantastic) interpretations of physical theory, you could swear he was just another physicist trying to cash in on the general public's vague understanding of science.(i.e. if you use a lot of fancy scientific terms and include a thick appendix at the end with equations that would remain incomprehensible to people without four Ph.D's, then you can get a majority of people thinking &quot;Yea! That sounds about right!&quot;) Combine this with most people's need to reconcile their religious fantasies with real discoveries about the universe and you have the makings of a best-seller/gold-mine!Something tells me though, that Dr. Tipler wouldn't spend so much time writing this huge book if he didn't half-way believe what he was preaching. There is so much in this book that makes for interesting (and fun) speculation -- exploring the universe with microscopic space probes, emulating personalities on supercomputers -- a lot of which has a good chance of happening in the not-so-very-distant future. As a good introduction to all kinds of ideas which sound like science fiction, but are really possible, this is a great book!However, if you're only looking for the real answer on immortality...you can save yourself a lot of time by considering only two of the arguments (the &quot;final&quot; arguments on which the whole theory rests): Tipler's assertion that the universe will collapse (&quot;the big crunch&quot;) into the Omega Point, and that life will be possible up until that point is reached. First, the most recent (and most accurate) measurements of the geometry of the universe seem to indicate that the universe will expand forever (i.e. will never collapse to a point). Second, even if the universe did collapse, life would absolutely not survive anywhere near the final point. The state of the building blocks of life (atoms) in whatever form life would come in (carbon- based, silicon-based, whatever-based...) would be torn apart in the final &quot;big crunch&quot;. No building blocks= No organization= No life. Even if THAT wasn't bad enough, consider the all-powerful supercomputer at the end of time that will supposedly resurrect us. Even the smallest, most compact supercomputer takes up space...yet even the Omega Point has no room for the tiniest imaginable computer...because a point is just that -- a singularity with no area. It seems unlikely that Dr. Tipler could miss that point (small pun intended)...so maybe he really WAS just trying to make a buck..."

The photography and reproduction is professional, and the work represented covers the range from the traditional jewelry boxes of Roy Tsumoto to the incredible concoctions of Po Shun Leong. I like this heterogeneous approach because each time I start looking through the book I find that my tastes and understanding get a bit broader. This is a tremendous source of ideas.Being a maker, I wish there were more technical details. On several occasions I found myself struggling to see how the artist created the box. In other words this is more about design than it is about engineering. But there is no curse without its blessing - making myself think of a way to carry out a design is good exercise. In any case, this book is invaluable for understanding the fine line between craft and art, one enclosed space after another."

This wasn't a pleasant dream. The book, as others have noted, is unfocused and loses a good story in a tiresome telling. I don't recall the page devoted to Peggy's favorite Life Savers flavor, but it's dangerously easy to imagine.What I found particularly frustrating was a lack of context as regards J.D. Salinger's publishing career. A chapter will open with a throwaway remark: ""And then Franny & Zooey appeared as a book"" and let it wither. Yes, it didn't matter much to her at the time, but the reader wants to know what was happening to the book in real life (how was it received, how did it advance J.D.'s fame), while Peggy's insane, isolated life unspun.You do pick up bits of mostly horrifying information about J.D. and you can't help but sympathize with Margaret Salinger, but you can wish that she had learned more from her father's earlier, tightly structured work, than from his final published pieces like the rambling Seymour: An Introduction.

It's a far better effort not only in terms of research but in depth and understanding. Kolata does do one thing Crosby doesn't: she relates events that are going on now in terms of finding samples of the virus and sequencing its genome. But since those invetsigations are still on-going, and since the crucial question about this virus remains unanswered-- i.e., why was it so much more deadly than other influenza viruses?-- Kolata can't provide satisfaction anyway, and a review of current work (which will soon be dated) is not enough to justify buying this derivative and superficial overblown newspaper story."

I advise parents looking for a book for their child to get this one if they are looking for an intellectual, thought-provoking, and captivating story. I recommend that a parent read the book first in order to be able to help your child understand it when they come to you with questions. The book may seem like a pleasant fiction book, but it has much deeper meaning about society. The book is set in a Utopian society (you may need to explain this to your child) where people live orderly and monotonous lives, until one boy is chosen for a special career of being the keeper of memories that existed before the society was created and he learns all that he was missing in life by being &quot;perfect&quot;. The best reading age would probably be 10-15, depending on your child and your assessment of their ability to understand the subject matter. Parents, this is a great opportunity to get your child thinking, but make sure that they understand what they are reading and the message is not wasted!"

First of all Terry Goodkind has almost no plot,and where there is a plot it copied from Robert Jordan. For Example, Richard[main character]is a woods guide(simple life) as Rand al'Thor was a sheperd(simple life).Rand becomes famous(Dragon Reborn), Richard becomes the true seeker.Rand is affected by the Prophecies of the Dragon, richard also has prophecies about him. Richard finds out he was not living with his real father, as does Rand (Aiel father). Rand has Cullandor(magical sword), while Richard has Sword of Truth. Rand finds out he can channel (magic powers), Richard finds out he has the gift. The Seanchan in WOT have collars to control magic (channeling), while in SOT there is the Rhadan. Aes Sedai in WOT, Sisters of Light in SOT. Black Ajah (Evil) in WOT, Sisters of the Dark in SOT. I mean the list is endless !!! Other than that Khalan is always JUST about to be raped before she uses her power. Book one by Denim Naas, book two Tyler.I know people criticize Jordan's writing but he's a trillion times better than Goodking, at least he has an original plot.Also in book 2 I CANNOT understand why Zedd Zeddiculus Zorainder had to put a death spell on Kahlan, I mean he's a Wizard of First Order! It's not like he cannot kill a few guards and councillors. Buying Goodkind's books are not worth your money and if you have too much money and must buy books, goodkind's books are not worth your TIME!! I suggest you read Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time or Song of Fire and Ice. I mean anything can be better than Goodkings trash, even some doepy child fiction like Weenie the Pooh. The only reason you could want to read goodkind's books is if you want to read Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time with different names and characters !"

However, after having read it and having struggled through many parts of the book, you find the book not very complicated anymore.Since many reviews have been written about the plot and characters of this marvelous book, I will proceed to write my feelings after reading it.Heller has done a great job of writing a book that basically satirizes World War II. This book is very complex, with its many plot twists and flashbacks, but not complex enough that readers will lose control of the main picture he is trying to paint. Readers young and old alike will be awed by the cruelty of the last world war while laughing through many other parts of the book. The amazing range of emotions regarding the book is what truly makes it a masterpiece.However, I must warn that readers will not be able to comprehend the full comical effect of the ""profoundness"" of this book very easily, as it requires a much higher level of reading than most other popular books."

0843952504,Lone Rider from Texas,,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,Chrijeff,1/1,4.0,1270598400,Westerns from the pulps,"This is a seven-story anthology from the years 1936-9, all of its entries originally published in the specialized ""pulp"" magazines of the day, including the third (""Lawman of Latigo Wells"") of Dawson's to see print. Like all Dawson's fiction, they exude a feel for the country and the people that is rarely matched by Western writers of today, and offer headlong action and good, tight plotting. Perhaps the best of the lot is ""This One Good Eye,"" in which an outlaw who left his young son to be reared by a friend many years ago learns that the young man has become a sheriff and run afoul of a long-time foe of the father's. His response is to travel to his son's town and get himself hired on as a deputy. (Not a few ""badmen"" did turn ""good"" and become famous upholders of the law.) In the title story, as in many of Dawson's, a man accused of a crime he didn't commit sets out to prove his innocence; ""Bushwhack Heritage"" turns on a son's bitter feelings toward his father combined with his curious reluctance to accuse the man of a murder he's sure his parent committed. The remainder of the collection is similar--good action stories with strong, lone heroes facing big odds. Readers of traditional Westerns should enjoy them, and teens just learning their way around the genre can read them without any concern on their parents' part that they may read something they shouldn't."

B000JWW1UG,Death in the Afternoon,,A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ,"Donald Mitchell ""Jesus Loves You!""",16/19,5.0,971654400,Introducing the Bull Fight to Potential Fans,"I don't approve of killing animals for entertainment, and this book did not change that disapproval. I endorse this book because of its qualities as a model for introducing a subject to a new learner, rather than for its subject matter.If you like bullfights, you will like this book because Death in the Afternoon will expand your understanding of what you see. If you want to go to bullfights, this is a good book also because it will tell you how to do so in the most enjoyable way for you.Most people will never attend a bullfight, because of ethical concerns, some personal dismay about their potential reaction to the violence and horror of the event, or due to lack of opportunity (bullfighting is mainly done in Spain and Mexico). Many of these people will have some interest in understanding more about bullfighting or the appeal and spectacle of the event. Death in the Afternoon provides you with a thoughtful way to satisfy any curiosity you may have.Hemingway set out to write &quot;an introduction to the modern Spanish bullfight and attempt[ed] to explain that spectacle both emotionally and practically.&quot; I think he more than succeeded.As a child, my parents sometimes took me to Tiajuana in Baja California where bullfights were regularly held on the weekends. We all agreed that we did not approve of killing bulls for sport, and never attended one. But my curiosity was aroused by the sight of the enormous crowds that regularly attended. Until reading this book, I could not understand the appeal. Now I do. I know that bullfights are not for me, but I now know why some like them very much.Hemingway leads you gently into the subject as though you were chatting while seated at a comfortable table in an outdoor cafe on a pleasant afternoon sipping your favorite beverages. In fact, for part of the book, he invents an &quot;old lady&quot; whom he converses with for comic effect.He tells you about his own experiences throughout beginning with, &quot;At the first bullfight I ever went to I expected to be horrified and perhaps sickened by what I had been led to believe would happen to the horses.&quot; It turned out that this was not his reaction at all. He liked the bullfight, and saw 1,500 bulls killed before writing this book. He also reports that many people he took to fights often experienced different emotions than they expected. Women who disliked violence did not automatically dislike bullfights, and macho men did not necessarily like them.The central emotion that &quot;good&quot; bullfights create is of grace in the face of death which is inspired by &quot;the closeness with which the matador brings the bull past his body and the slowness with which he can execute the pass.&quot;In the period about which he writes, the 1920s into 1931, bullfighting was in a &quot;decadent&quot; age brought about by a fascination with coming ever closer to the bull's horn and doing more and more elaborate cape work. In addition to the death of many bulls, this also brought about horrible injuries and death for virtually every bullfighter mentioned. That brings special meaning to Hemingway's assertion that bullfighting &quot;is not a sport in the Anglo-Saxon sense . . . .&quot; &quot;Rather it is a tragedy, the death of the bull . . . .&quot; But you will also come to know the tragedy of Joselito, Manuel Granero, and Maera.Despite my objections to bullfighting, I was tremendously impressed by Hemingway's powers of observation. You will learn about so many miniscule aspects and details of bullfighting, that it will leave your head spinning. For example, a bull that erratically charges to one side or another has to be handled much differently in each pass than one who is like a mechanical bull and is very predictable. Bullfighters prefer the latter, but some of the best work is with the former if the bull is malleable. Does the bullfighter try to teach the bull, or simply survive the experience? The reaction of the bullfighter tells much about his character. The reaction of the fans tells much about their knowledge and character. You feel like you are looking at the world through many revolving kaleidescopes as images are considered in the context of other images, like an unending house of mirrors.The book says a lot about character -- the character of those involved in bullfighting and the fans. Although Hemingway admires the &quot;honor&quot; of those who face death bravely and act properly in the bull ring, he also points out that too much &quot;honor&quot; is dangerous. In essence, he makes an argument against the values of bullfighting even though he is an aficionado.He is honest with us, by also sharing his own failed experiences with trying to learn to fight the bulls.The book is greatly aided by many detailed and impressive photographs that illustrate the points in the book that would otherwise be lost on the reader who has not attended a bullfight. There is also a 61 page glossary of terms to help you handle all of the new concepts he throws at you.There are some incidental benefits for those who decide not to attend bullfights. Hemingway provides many detailed descriptions of the geography, weather, and characteristics of the people in different parts of Spain. I got several ideas for places I would like to visit on future trips as a result. At the end, he laments that he could not work in the rest of Spain into the book beginning with the Prado. I shared that lament, because a similar book on Spain by Hemingway would have been even more interesting and valuable to me. I can only imagine what his other wonderful descriptions would have been like.I suggest you take this book and outline it to see the process by which Hemingway takes you from being a neophyte to a quite well-grounded person about bullfighting. How could you do the same for a subject that you need to introduce many people to? If you learn from his story-telling skills, you will be well-rewarded for your experience."

It's perfect. Douglas Adams turns the English language into either the rantings of an existential crackpot -- or pure upside-down damn-the-rules poetry, the kind you find in Kids Say the Darndest Things, or Emma Donoghue's brilliant novel, Room.The only reason this book won't stand the test of time is if our species gets rid of all the digital watches.Okay. So what can be said about a book with 685 five-star reviews?And why would anyone review it now?Reviewers who wish to be seen hovering above the mass of grocery store lit are always peering into the higher shelves in search of something that challenges the general mediocrity of our fiction, a plot that explodes the senses, or a character sufficiently outrageous that the mind reels trying to grasp the nuances and diagnose the sickness of the author.Such a book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is not.Well, all right, the spacy berserkitude of The Guide challenges mediocrity. One might make a case that Adams is an embarrassment to the 21st Century dumbing-down of the imagination. And what this book also does, or did in 1979, was to raise the bar for the acceptably weird. There was a time when weird was Last Exit to Brooklyn, or Ulysses, or One Hundred Years of Solitude, or going way back, Walt Whitman's magnificent and unpublishable Leaves of Grass. These books of course are literature. Douglas Adams would be the first to admit he did not create any literature. But what he did create was altogether nuts.Let's see... somewhere in the Galaxy, people are running a 10-million-year-long experiment in which the Earth is actually a giant computer. Five minutes before the experiment concludes, Vogons blow up the planet because it's in the path of a hyperspace by-pass and must be eliminated. Within days it is revealed that a new technology has superseded the need for the hyperspace by-pass! Wow! You gotta love it!This is my personal literary grail, devoutly to be sought: No Rules. No disbelief to suspend. No irony left unsmelted, no buckle left unswashed. Characters marching mindlessly through the narrative with or without balls or cause. And most crucial to Gonzolit, a sense of the absurd so delicious that no discerning reader can fail to appreciate it.That is why God gave us Douglas Adams."
